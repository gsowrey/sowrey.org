I have a blog called [The Observer's Log](https://geoff.sowrey.org). It was a place for me to write my stories, tell everyone a little about what I was doing when I was living so far from home. I don't write much in it anymore, largely because I became disinterested in the soapbox preachiness that I had somehow waded into. I struggled with relevancy and purposefulness, especially where time was involved: I didn't want to waste time by not telling a story.

That's what this place is all about: I want to tell new stories. And I hope you'll join me on this journey.
