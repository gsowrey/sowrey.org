If you've read the homepage, then you know this site is about stories. I'm not looking to write the Great Canadian Novel (pretty sure there's a host of people who've beaten me to that), though I do have one or two ideas that I've had to get out of my head and onto paper (virtually, anyway). 

This site used to be my blog (so says [The Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org)) which I wrote in for years. I found, though, that the minuate of my life were far less interesting as I got older than the ideas floating in my head that, frankly, started to crowd out the rest of the things I wanted to say. The only way was to write them down. 

Since I'm such a sharing kind of guy, I felt it would be helpful to get them all down in one place. And since I feel these are now more important than the aforementioned minutae, I felt it fitting to take over the primary domain. 

I hope you enjoy them!
