<p>In Grade 11, I got a job, one I got myself instead of having it given to me. The two years before, I had been a general labourer at the company my father worked for, a shop boy who swept up after the guys who built diesel generators, helped build a contained office for my boss, Richard, moved things around with a forklift, and generally got dirty as hell. It paid decent, but I worked my father&#8217;s longer hours, as he was my ride to and from work.</p>



<p>In Grade 11, my mother showed me that Black&#8217;s Camera was hiring. Black&#8217;s barely exists anymore, reduced to little more than a website doing photo reproduction work. In 1988, it was still one of the major chains that worked with film (interestingly, 1988 was also the year the first-ever digital SLR was released, though I wouldn&#8217;t know of that for over another decade), so the hour-print service in the store was usually busy. </p>



<p>I had gotten the job because I knew a bit about cameras and film and how they worked together to make pictures; ASA/ISOs, primarily. My father had given me my first SLR &#8212; a Minolta X370 &#8212; just prior to my SEVEC adventure a few years earlier, and I had used it as much as I could afford to (well, as must as my parents were willing to pay for my pictures, anyway &#8212; this was one reason my mother pressed me to get the job at Black&#8217;s).</p>



<p>Our store was perhaps one of the dumpier ones. It was in Trafalgar Village, a perpetual &#8220;death mall&#8221; where stores typically didn&#8217;t last. I never really understood why &#8212; the mall was wedged between the GO station and the QEW, had good road access, and a big parking lot. But everyone avoided it. It was an I-shaped mall, with the ends being the anchors: Food City (the grocery store) on one end, Woolco on the other. The Black&#8217;s was wedged right next to the Woolco entrance inside the mall, so we had a fair bit of foot traffic. </p>



<p>The anchor stores would change over time. Woolco closed down and was bought out by Walmart as it set foot in Canada. The Food City would eventually become a No Frills, a literal no-name brand food store where everything is labeled yellow with only words, as basic as it gets. The Walmart would eventually moved and be replaced by a Home Depot. After the Walmart moved, Trafalgar Village was mostly razed, the centre section of the I demolished, leaving the anchor buildings &#8230; and the Golden Griddle, a waffle house, which only recently closed.  </p>



<p>I worked with a small group: three developers, two (other) sales people, the assistant manager, and the manager, Sue. I got along particularly well with Mark (one of the sales people) and Jessica (one of the developers), both of whom went to Sheridan College, and both of whom loved <em>Monty Python</em>. It was from them I got my initial education in all things British Absurdist, even to the point where I had watched <em>Monty Python and The Holy Grail</em> before going to the University of Waterloo, where <em>The Holy Grail</em> is the unofficial movie mascot. </p>



<p>I was the kid. The young one. I did the bulk of the intake for film, both the hourly service and the special orders. Despite Sue&#8217;s encouragement, I didn&#8217;t feel comfortable doing sales, partly because I was in an introverted period of my life, but also because Mark and the other sales staff were so much better at it. Mark did teach me a number of things, but I only ever once sold a camera during the Christmas rush. </p>



<p>Every day that I worked, I would trudged over after school. Oakville Trafalgar High School was a kilometre and a half from Black&#8217;s, a quick bike ride or a walk (in the only winter I worked there). On the days that I walked, I brought my portable cassette player, which regularly featured The Rolling Stones&#8217; <em>Hot Rocks</em> album, a two-cassette compilation (my first and only double-cassette album) that stayed almost permanently in that player. </p>



<p>Aside from <em>Get Off My Cloud</em>, it had many of the Stones&#8217; other classics, such as <em>(I Can&#8217;t Get No) Satisfaction</em>, <em>Brown Sugar</em>, <em>Gimme Shelter</em>, <em>Paint It Black</em>, and <em>Sympathy For The Devil</em>. I distinctly remember walking across a cold, snow-filled parking lot to the southwest entrance of Trafalgar Village one dark evening, Mick and crew blaring in my headphones. I played all four sides constantly, but found side three (Side A of Tape 2), which started off with <em>Jumpin&#8217; Jack Flash</em>, a frequently-played side, often rewound and restarted. And there&#8217;s a reason. </p>



<p>In Hamilton, two cities to the west of Oakville, at the northwestern end of Lake Ontario, there is a television station that went by the call letters CHCH. In my youth, it was one of the few TV stations that didn&#8217;t have affiliations with CBC, CTV, Global, or CHUM, which were the major communications companies at the time. This allowed them to do pretty much whatever the hell they wanted, and what they did was produce <em>The Hilarious House Of Frightenstein</em>, a classic horror-esque kids show about an incompetent scientist unable to bring his Frankenstein-like monster (&#8220;Brucie&#8221;) to life, and the people who lived in his castle.</p>



<p>Of note in this menagerie of people (most of whom were all played by the same actor, Billy Van), the Wolfman stood out the most to me (other than Vincent Price &#8212; yes, <em>that</em> Vincent Price &#8212; because &#8230; well, <em>Vincent Price</em>). The Wolfman (modelled after &#8220;Wolfman Jack&#8221;, the real US DJ) was the host of the radio station, whose segment always opened with a brief cut of Sly and the Family Stone&#8217;s <em>I Want To Take You Higher</em>. He would talk a bit, then he would play his song of the day, which usually involved him and Igor (another character in the show) walking into a psychedelic background (filmed on a blue screen; the &#8220;I&#8221; on Igor&#8217;s shirt would go transparent and always show the background) and danced to the song. One frequent play of theirs was <em>Jumpin&#8217; Jack Flash</em>. </p>



<p>I worked at Black&#8217;s until late fall of 1988. I had started a Co-operative Education stream at high school, which strived to put students into &#8220;real&#8221; jobs to get them an initial kick at life. (I would do this again in university, which paid for my education.) I was placed in a computer store downtown, for which I had the world&#8217;s shortest interview (I begged for longer one, just because I needed the credit). Although an unpaid position, I spent so much time there helping out that I ran my required 200 hours in short term, and Rob (the boss) hired me outright. I was relieved as the Black&#8217;s job no longer had the appeal, as Sue had returned to the Jackson Square location in Hamilton and her replacement was trying to make a name for himself in all the worst ways. I quit over the phone and never worked a shift there ever again. </p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">“Professor, we have a problem!” Carl announced, trotting into his office.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Batesworth looked away from the schematics on his walls. “What is now, Carl?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Jo’s killed an Engineer!”</p>



<p>Batesworth slumped slightly. “What? How?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“She took a bunch of people on the roof—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I know, she was down here a few hours ago looking for volunteers. You took back the ones on the canyon floor not too long ago. The rest were on the roof making repairs.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The wind came up,” Carl said. The corner of his mouth curled. “She threw one of them to his death.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“‘Threw’?” Batesworth’s eyebrow crested like a wave. “Jo’s not one to throw people, even at her worst.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“She left him to die.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That’s different than ‘throw’, Carl,” said Batesworth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’re missing the point, Professor!” Carl pressed. “Someone’s dead and it’s Jo’s fault!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I understand your concern, Carl, but I need more details. What <em>exactly</em> happened?” Batesworth stood and scanned Carl’s face.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The group was on the roof, the wind picked up, and Jo left one behind. <em>Intentionally</em>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“She knowingly left someone out there in the windstorm?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yes.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“And you were there to witness this, yourself, with your own eyes?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl hesitated. “No, I was back in the tunnels when—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“And you know what happened, how?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Dawn told me,” said Carl. “She was there. She saw the whole thing. She can vouch for everything I’ve just told you!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Anyone else see this?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl chewed a moment. “There’s that guy that’s been hanging around with her, her assistant,” he said grudgingly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Batesworth nodded. “Do you know the name of the deceased?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I thought you knew the names of all the Engineers, Carl.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“He was … an Apprentice, I think.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That’s an important detail, hmm?” Batesworth returned to his chair. “Jo led a team to the roof, which included her assistant, Dawn, and some Apprentices. The wind picked up, and Jo <em>intentionally</em> left someone outside. That’s your statement?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl nodded. “Yes. Intentionally killed someone.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How is it that you’re always the one to come in here and tell me that the Engineers are committing horrible acts, Carl?” Batesworth took a deep breath and let it slowly back out. “Where is Jo now?”</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>The lowest point of the ARCH was on the downward slope of the canyon floor, a crawlspace under Block 9’s bottom floor as it spanned over boulders. The outside wind caused just enough of a draft through the multitude of gaps to keep the dark void dusty. A lone figure lay in a well-used patch, curled up in the dimness, her back turned against the small world behind. The wind was little more than a low moaning, the high-velocity winds affecting only the older, upper options of the structure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite all efforts to the contrary, the figure would not be left alone long.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Jo,” called a voice near the void’s mouth. “Come out. Talk to me.” With an apparent lack of response or motion, Erik sat down on the ground and peered in. “I know you’re in there. As much as you think you can hide away, you can’t. I know your places, even this one.” He waited a few moments for any kind of acknowledgement. “I can’t say I know what you’re going through. I don’t. I’ve not done what you’ve done — wait, sorry, that wasn’t… I don’t know how to do what you do, how you see things and their effects. You saw the problems before anyone else, you’re the only one who spoke up about them. You saw the value of the wind having died down before any of us were … were willing to do anything about it.” Erik looked for movement. “Going outside is risky, too many of us are terrified of what could happen that we never think about alternative.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Carl did,” said Jo, her response muted and echoey. “He thinks I’m too stupid to think of the risks.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah, he mentioned something like that to me,” Erik nodded. “You know what I told him?” Erik waited for a response that didn’t come. “I told him that you’re the only one brave enough to go outside. The only one smart enough to know the risks of going outside. People followed you because they trust you, Jo. They know what you’re capable of. It doesn’t matter what Carl thinks or says. He’s so afraid of you that his mouth speaks before his brain thinks and he just looks worse every time. You did what needed to be done, the only one courageous enough to open the door and step outside.” He stopped looking into the void, brought his knees to his chin and stared off across the space. “People trust you, follow you. That’s way more than … well, pretty much more than the rest of us can say. People listen to us, but they don’t believe us, not me or Rich or Carl or Bonnie or Francis. When you speak, they believe you.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo appeared at Erik’s side. “Do you believe me?”</p>



<p>Erik smiled. “Always.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Slowly, Jo reached out and touched Erik on the shoulder. “Gracias, cariño.Yo necesitaba eso.” She sidled up next to him like cat. “Te necesito.” Hesitantly, Erik moved his arm around her. She pulled his arm all the way around her, encouraging a tight hold. “Te amo,” she whispered.&nbsp;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>“Have a seat,” said Batesworth, tapping a chair he had brought into his cramped office. Jo, her arms wrapped around herself tightly, looked at Batesworth, then the chair. She looked back towards Erik, who stood out of Batesworth’s view. “I just want to talk, Jo. We have to talk.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo tentatively stepped into the room and slowly sat on the front part of the seat, her arms still in place. She looked at a random diagram on the wall, not registering anything else about it. “I killed someone,” she said softly. “I killed Henry.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Batesworth leaned forward, resting his elbows on his chair. “I’ve heard. I don’t suppose you want to talk about what happened?” Jo fiercely shook her head. “We can’t ignore this, Jo. It’s happened. As much as you might want to forget it, you can’t change what was done.” He leaned back to sit upright. “I won’t ask if you think you’re responsible. You take responsibility far more seriously than most.” He looked at Jo’s unmoving expression, her eyes locked on a point many yards past the picture on the wall. “This isn’t something we can’t sweep away, even if it was one of us. You know that, right?” Jo nodded slightly. “We will have to convene a tribunal.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo stiffened. “I … they … if I’m convicted … you’ll banish me.” Tears erupted and rolled down her cheek.</p>



<p>Batesworth watch the drops seep down her skin, falling loose from her chin, onto the floor with a light <em>pit</em> sound, forming a tiny mud puddle from the dust. “It’s a possibility,” he nodded. “If you are convicted, the Council has the right to pass judgement, which includes the potential for banishment. But I don’t think the Council will—“</p>



<p>“Carl hates me,” said Jo. “He banished Robert. He hated Robert, too. Frank will say what Carl says.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Carl is opinionated, no less than you. You fought for Robert’s clemency, as I recall, very vehemently.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo faced Batesworth. “I’m on trial, Rich. I don’t get a say.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Batesworth leaned forward again, nodding. “True. That is true. In fact, we’ll probably have a stalemate. We’ll have to include another person for quorum.”</p>



<p>“Dawn,” said Jo.</p>



<p>“Perhaps,” said Batesworth. “Francis might have a few words to say about that.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When?” said Jo.</p>



<p>“Francis? Well, I haven’t talked to him yet—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The trial.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Oh. Not at least for a day or two. We’ll have to prepare, talk to witnesses, you know the process. I have to find Agatha and make sure she’s still willing to participate.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Jail.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Jail?” Batesworth asked. “You?” He shook his head. “Jail … locking you up in a room doesn’t help anyone right now. You’re not on a murderous spree, you do not pose a risk.” He scratched at his chin. “If anything, I would say putting you <em>in</em> jail is a risk to all of us. As I recall, you’re working on that reinforcement in the greenhouse.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo nodded slowly.</p>



<p>“How much work is left?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I … I’m not sure,” said Jo. “We … um, we have mould blocks. We, uh, have to carve them… then the workshop can cast. If that goes well, maybe … three days? I think?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Erik!” Batesworth called. Erik appeared at the doorway. “We will be conducting a tribunal to investigate the death of Apprentice Henry … last name?” Batesworth looked at both Erik and Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Sorry, I didn’t even know his first name,” Erik said. Jo shook her head.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We will ensure to get that detail,” said Batesworth. “In the meantime, Ms. De Leon is on suspension until the tribunal. If anyone asks, she is being isolated from the population.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“And in reality?” Erik asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Saving the ARCH.”&nbsp;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>“I’m going to die,” shuddered Jo. “Carl will make sure of it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Carl can stuff it,” said Erik. The two of them walked down the hallway towards the stairs that would take them to the greenhouse. “Carl thinks he’s the King of the ARCH and his rule is law. I wouldn’t worry about him. Besides, the tribunal won’t convict you.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How do you know?” asked Jo through a sob. “Carl will make sure Rich only hears lies. Agatha doesn’t even like me.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“She doesn’t like any of the Engineers,” said Erik. “But she knows what we do is important.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“She doesn’t like me,” Jo repeated. “Two to one.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’re assum—,” Erik cut himself off. “Sorry, I … this isn’t the right time to be cute.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo stopped. “Siempre eres lindo,” she said through a thin smile. “It’s okay. I might have laughed at it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No, you wouldn’t have,” said Erik. They arrived at the door and he let her go down first. They descended the stairs slowly, Jo taking each step with a confident suspicion. They said nothing until they reached the bottom.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ellas me van a rechazar,” Jo said, looking at the gardeners.</p>



<p>“Huh?”</p>



<p>“They know,” said Jo. “They’ll hate me.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Why would that do that?” asked Erik. “You’re about the only person in this place who recognizes them. You know their names, where they came from.” As if in response, Jo’s name burst from within the plants. Heads popped up immediately behind the verge.&nbsp; whose arms were caked in dirt. Over a dozen leaped up, frantically rubbing the dirt from their hands and arms, and ran across the floor to Jo, all crying various things that Erik couldn’t understand. As they approached, Jo cringed defensively. “You know their life stories, Jo,” he said to her ear. “You’re a part of their family.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anita was the first to arrive. “¡Que el amor de Dios te proteja, Jo!” She wrapped herself around Jo and held her tightly. “Lo que necesites, solo tienes que preguntar.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>One by one, all of the gardeners held Jo and spoke. Erik stepped away as the crowd grew too large for him to remain near. With each person, Jo slumped a little less, smiled a little more. When the last had offered condolences and love, Jo looked at each of them, her face wet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Gracis, todos. Sin ustedes, soy nada,” said Jo. Her smile wavered and cracked, her face folded, and her strength fled. Jo fell to her knees and burst out in a wail that echoed throughout the cavernous space. “Soy nada!” she continued, as her friends gathered, surrounding her completely.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donner approached Erik. “Is she … okay?”</p>



<p>“No.” Erik held his arms around himself. “I don’t know if any of us will be.” &nbsp;</p>
