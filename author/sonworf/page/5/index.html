<p class="has-drop-cap">Jo stared at the dark orange shape, neither able to truly recognize what it was or what it should look like. She picked it up slowly, turning it over carefully as if too sudden a movement might cause it to explode.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What do you think?” asked Donner. They were sitting against the reservoir, the commotion of the previous hour having died away and activities returning largely to normal. “Does it look okay?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Where… where does this go?” Jo asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That’s the support mount,” said Donner. “It would go up there,” he pointed about ten feet off the ground at a point marked with a piece of chalk. “I carved it so it would fit the eye of the girder,” he pointed to the girder lying on the ground. “The one we got from Block 3 will fit perfect.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How…” Jo held out the block and tried to visualize it being in place with the girder coming out towards the reservoir wall. “How did you get the angle?” The shackle on the mount was not orthogonal to the plate, and tilted to the side.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Rope,” said Donner. “I tied it off at the mark, and brought it down to the shackle on the wall.” He pointed to the dull grey metal shackle on the wall, held in place with a pair of metal rods poking out of the holes. “Phil brought it down this morning while we were on the … while we were … um …”</p>



<p>“We were on the roof,” Jo finished.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Sorry,” Donner mumbled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Don’t be,” said Jo. “You had nothing to do with … that.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I was there,” said Donner. “I saw what happened.” He reached out and tapped Jo’s knee. “And I’m here. I can’t be like them,” he waved towards the gardeners, “I can’t speak Spanish, and I’m definitely not as good at this stuff as you are, but I want to help.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>A small smile returned Donner’s words. “Thanks, Donner.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Hey, what are assistants for, right?” he smiled back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’re a friend,” said Jo. “And they’re in short supply right now.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>They smiled at one another for a moment, then each picked up a cube of orange wax. Silently, they started to work on the next set of molds that were needed for the second girder. Their knives, stubby and thin from too many sharpenings, whittled away at the blocks, slowly revealing the shapes that would eventually be cast in metal. Flick by flick, little bits of orange filled the ground in front of them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The field of orange in front of Jo was more bare than Donner’s. Her knife moved with less certainty, less need, removing small flecks; Donner produced pieces easily the size of his finger with every swipe. Jo looked absently at her block of wax, the knife tracing and retracing the shape to be, the shape locked inside, begging to be freed, its carver unaware her actions were fruitless.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A twist of the blade plunged the knife down, burying it so it couldn’t move forward. Jo humphed and tried to move it again. She struggled and pushed, swearing under her breath. The knife buried up to its handle was stuck. Jo pulled hard at the handle, the knife initially refusing to budge, somehow sensing the next moments. Unable to stop, Jo tugged and wiggled and grunted and pushed and kicked the knife free. She changed her grip, the blade moving from being out of her&nbsp; hand by the thumb, to protruding from her fist near her pinky finger. She plunged the knife into the block with a frustrated scream. She pulled the knife out, and repeated. Again and again, she stabbed at the block, the dark orange turning a lighter hue with each gouge, Jo’s voice becoming a shredded howl echoing in the greenhouse.</p>



<p>Donner caught her hand before she plunged the knife again. Jo didn’t resist as he carefully pried the knife from her hand and tossed it away. Her voice contracted and sucked inward into a wail, then to a soft sobbing. Donner gingerly lowered Jo’s arm, pushed the wax block away, and wrapped his arms around Jo.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>“This looks like shit,” said Jo, holding the shape in her hand. It had taken Donner and Jo several hours to carve Jo’s block into the shackle that was needed. Whereas Donner’s mounting bracket — a far similar shape — was smooth, Jo’s was haggard with remnants of her stabbing fit.</p>



<p>“Once it melts, the outside shape will hold, right?” said Donner. “These little marks won’t show up.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Still looks like shit.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So long as it holds, that’s all we need, Jo,” Donner asked assuredly.</p>



<p>Jo looked at Donner. “Thanks. Really. I, uh, I couldn’t have done this without you Donner. Any of this.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What’re friends for?” Donner said, not really a question. “Let’s go get these cast. The sooner we have real parts, the sooner we can get these put in.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’re starting to sound like me,” Jo said as they started towards the stairs. “I wish I sounded like me.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You will,” said Donner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Up the stairs and down the hallways and into the Atrium they went, creeping around the various sleeping figures while the roof rattled far above, sand falling and drifting in the still air. The workshop door was closed, as usual, and Donner pounded for attention. The slot slid open and Donner held up the blocks.</p>



<p>“We need these cast!” he said proudly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Who are you?” asked the eyes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donner stepped back to reveal Jo. “I’m with Jo.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The eyes glared. “Come to throw us off the roof, too?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That’s not funny,” said Donner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“She killed a guy,” the eyes accused.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Someone died in the wind,” said Donner soberly. He looked the eyes carefully. “Did you know him?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How many people have died here?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How many people have died in the ARCH?” asked Donner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I don’t—“</p>



<p>“And you don’t know most of them,” said Donner. “How many have died in the tunnels?” Donner stepped right to the eyes, looking squarely at them. “Do you know any of them? Does the guy running the tunnels catch shit for it?” The slot slammed shut.</p>



<p>“Donner, I’m not sure—,“ said Jo.</p>



<p>“It’s not fair that they pick on you when so many others are hurt and killed in the tunnels. They’ve singled you out!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo nodded. “Sí.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The workshop door opened. Donner looked at Jo, then both went through. Phil waited for them on the other side.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Hey Jo,” said Phil quietly. “The, uh, guys are…”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Being assholes!” Donner shouted. “It was an accident!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Donner, don’t,” Jo cautioned. “Phil, we need these cast. Rapido. Can you get these in?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I dunno,” Phil said, glancing over his shoulder towards the roaring smelter. “They’re finishing up a pour. I think we can get these to you in a few hours. That good enough?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo nodded. “Yeah.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You okay, Jo?” asked Phil. Jo looked at Phil with a blank expression. “Was it an accident?” Jo didn’t react.</p>



<p>“It was,” said Donner. “I saw it all. She tried to save him. Jo wanted to go back out and bring him back. But the wind was too strong and there was no safety suit.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phil glanced around him and leaned in towards Jo. “I’m sorry, Jo. Carl came in here, and … well, you know. I believe what he,” Phil nodded towards Donner, “said. I believe you tried. I’ll … I’ll see if I can get the guys here to believe, too.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo wiped away a tear and nodded. “Gracias, Phil.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“C’mon, Jo,” said Donner, pulling gently on her arm. “You need to get some rest.”&nbsp;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Jo slept in the greenhouse, tucked around the side of the reservoir. The fitful sleep was interrupted multiple times by her own sudden shrieks and cries, bolting upright to realize her whereabouts, then coaxed back to sleep by Donner, who barely slept himself. Donner retrieved the heavy metal mounts from the workshop, one at a time, lugging them slowly through the atrium, down the hallways and (very carefully) down the stairs. The sound of the second, heavier one, woke Jo from her light slumber.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo came around the corner of the reservoir to find Donner crumpled against the wall, heaving. His hands, despite wearing some borrowed heavy gloves, were bloodied from the rough edges of the shackle having torn into his flesh.</p>



<p>“Díos mio!” Jo cried and went to him. “Are you okay?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Me? Yeah,” Donner said panting. “These things are heavy.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Your hands!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah, the edges are a bit rough.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Es mi culpa.”</p>



<p>“I’ll live,” said Donner. “Give me a minute and we can get this first one in place.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Bueno.”</p>



<p>With the gloves doubled over, she dragged the shackle to its point on the wall, and the mounting bracket to its strut. Throwing a rope though a strut nearly twenty feet up, she tied the mounting bracket and pulled it up to its approximate height up the strut and tied it off. By the time she was finished, Donner was lifting the shackle up the wall to align with the holes. It took both of them, with significant grunting and more than a few curses in two languages to fit the first rock bolt into a corner, dangling the shackle by its corner.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>“I assume we need this?” Donner produced a long pole with a goosenecked socket. Jo nodded and Donner fitted the socket over the end of the rock bolt. Initially just twisting the pole, the gooseneck attachment became more prominent as the bolt tightened into the hole, the pole swaying out to the sides with every rotation, until half-turns were the only possibility, the both of them pulling hard on each twist. They left the bolt with a quarter inch of space remaining.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“One down, five to go,” said Donner, picking up another bolt. They slid the shackle along the way, pivoting on the one bolt, and tapped another bolt into the opposite corner. The pole was attached, and the twisting ballet resumed. One by one, all six bolts were put in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Why didn’t we,” Donner panted while Jo downed a large bottle of water, “tighten them?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Binding,” Jo burped. “If we’d tightened too soon, the bolts might have pulled the shackle too much and the other bolts wouldn’t get in properly.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Oh,” Donner nodded. “I think I get it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Oh, you’ll get it the first time you bind something and have to undo all the bolts to fix it.”</p>



<p>Following a zig-zag pattern, Donner and Jo tightened each bolt until it was flush with the shackle, and the shackle was pulled as tightly into the wall as possible. Jo climbed up on top of it and gave a good jump, not so much as causing a speck of dust to fall. “Que hará.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Now the strut?” asked Donner, looking up at the dangling bracket.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Sí,” said Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“And how do we get up there?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ladder.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donner looked at Jo. “Not ‘ladders’?” he asked, stressing the plurality.</p>



<p>“Ladder,” Jo reiterated. “We’ve got one that’ll reach. I’ll go get it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ladder, a foldable model acquired years earlier while scavenging through nearly-abandoned towns, had seen much abuse. Unfolded, its top came to just above the point at which the bracket would wrap around the strut.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It says load limit of 250 pounds,” said Donner, reading what was left of a label stuck inside one of the legs. He looked at the erected ladder with trepidation. “You want both of us to go up there?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We need three hands at least,” said Jo, tucking a wrench in one pocket, and bolts in the other. “I can’t weigh more than a hundred.” She glanced over Donner, who despite his height was much skinnier. “I’d give you maybe the same.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, but this ladder is beat up.”</p>



<p>“Well, if you’d stop eating all those donuts, we wouldn’t have a problem,” smirked Jo.</p>



<p>“God, I miss donuts.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo went up the ladder first and secured the top with the end of the rope that also held the bracket in the air, simultaneously adjusting the bracket’s position so that it aligned exactly with where it needed to be. She then wrapped the rest of the rope around her waist and swung around the strut so that she straddled the strut, her feet on the third rung down from the top. “¡Vamos!” she called to Donner, waving him up. Donner checked the large rocks at the base of the ladder, holding the feet in place, then slowly crawled his way to the top.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With his weight on the ladder, Donner was the lucky one who got to hold up the rear of the bracket so that Jo could push through the bolts with one hand — the other holding herself onto the strut — until the back was held enough in place for Donner to use a hand to turn on the nuts. With the bracket held just enough in place, Donner blissfully descended the ladder again to hold the base, while Jo swung back around to the ladder side again. With a slight tap of the hammer to move the bracket back down to match the mark on the strut, Jo tightened the bolts, then descended back down, the rope still tied around her waist.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Girder?” Donner asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Girder,” said Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How do we get this thing in place?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’ll lift up the top with the rope—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Is it strong enough?” Donner asked, looking at the dingy, frayed twists.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Let’s hope so,” said Jo. “Once the top is up, we’ll attach the bottom,” she pointed to the shackle in the wall, “then attach the top.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This would be so much easier with more people,” Donner commented.</p>



<p>“Then we get to do it all over again!” Jo smiled dryly, pointing at the opposite end of the reservoir, which sat waiting for the next bout of work to begin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donner slumped. “Not funny.”</p>



<p>“Wasn’t meant to be,” said Jo, tying off the end of the girder around the outside of the eye. “C’mon…”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The rope whizzed and wheezed as Jo and Donner used their collective weight to pull the girder from the ground. Eventually reaching a point above the mounting bracket on the strut, they tied the rope off, then lifted the other end of the girder on top of the shackle mounted on the reservoir wall. They wiggled the eye of the girder repeatedly, but it steadfastly refused to fall into the slot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Mierda,” muttered Jo.</p>



<p>“I think I goofed on the measurements,” said Donner. “That ruler is weird.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I don’t think it was the ruler,” said Jo. “We calculated for contraction. But something’s odd with this alloy.” She crouched down and looked closely at the shackle. She scratched at the surface. “Phil mention anything about what this is made of?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Um, no, he didn’t say. Why?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This doesn’t look like steel,” she said, taking a wrench and scratching heavily. The dull outside gave way to a shinier interior. “Malditos. Did those morons dump bronze in there?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Bronze?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There’s a yellowy metal mixed in. A little bit, but it didn’t mix properly.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So&#8230;?”</p>



<p>“You ever bake a cake?” asked Jo.</p>



<p>“Yeah, long time ago,” said Donner. “I miss cake, too.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You ever mix it so badly that you saw chunks of flour?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No, but my brother did that with pancakes once. Grossest pancakes I ever ate.” Donner stuck out his tongue to the memory.</p>



<p>“Same thing happens in metals. You don’t mix it right, you can have structural issues.” She scraped at another section. The same flecks appeared. “I really hope it’s only at the outsides.” She looked up at the strut. “We don’t have time for them to do it again.” She shook her head. “Espero que esto funcione.” She walked over to a large metal mallet sitting on the ground and heaved it up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What’s that for?” asked Donner.</p>



<p>She pointed the mallet at the girder. “One way or another, that’s going in. Hold it in place, will you?” Donner held the girder such that the eye was aligned with the slot. Jo wound up and drove the mallet’s head onto the edge of the two inch-thick eye. Barely budging, it rang loudly, causing several of the gardeners to jump in surprise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“¡Disculpame!” Jo called back sheepishly. “Esto será ruidoso.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo wound up again and drove the mallet back down, with similar results. After three more swings, she held the mallet out to Donner. They switched places, and he swung four times. On the fourth hit, Jo could see that the edge of the eye had peeled against the shackle slightly, enough that the eye had dipped about an eighth of an inch into the slot. Nodding, she reached out for the mallet and they swapped places. Swing, <em>bong</em>. Swing, <em>bong</em>. Swing, <em>bong</em>. Switch. Swing, <em>bong</em>. Swing, <em>bong</em>. Swing, <em>bong</em>. Swing, <em>bong</em>. Switch. Slowly, the <em>bong</em> reverberated less and became more of a <em>bonk</em>, and the eye slipped more and more into the slot. About two-thirds of the way in, however, the eye became irretrievably stuck and refused to move any further.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What do we do?” asked Donner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No se.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Don’t say what?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“¡NO SE!” Jo shouted. “IT MEANS ‘I DON’T KNOW’!” Donner cringed. Jo cringed as well and shook her head. “I’m… sorry, Donner. I’m so sorry. I’m…”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I know,” Donner said quietly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No,” said Jo. “You don’t know. That’s not your fault. It’s mine. I’m … I’m tired. I’m <em>exhausted</em>. I’m a murderer.” Donner moved to speak and Jo immediately threw out her hand. “Don’t. It’s what happened. I’m wrong. I’ve made a mistake.” She looked at the eye-shackle union. “Two mistakes. And I can’t … I just can’t. I can’t do this anymore. This place is beating me.” She whacked the eye with the mallet. “It keeps beating me.” She whacked it again. “It thinks it can get the <em>better</em>—,“ she slammed the mallet into the eye, “—of me! It does it again—,” <em>whack</em>, “—<em>again—,</em>” <em>whack</em>, “—<em>again</em>—,” <em>wham</em>, “—<em>y otra vez, su maltida</em>—,” <em>WHAM</em>, “—<em>PINCHE</em>—“, <em>WHAM</em>, “—<em>HIJO DE PUTA</em>!” She drove a furious slap into the eye, and the girder suddenly shifted an entire inch, nearly fitting exactly where it needed to be. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Huh,” said Donner. “At least it’ll be a tight fit.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Jo lay on her cot, staring at the cracked paint on her ceiling, her mind turned cinema replaying the same scene. A light shrill undulated over the howling wind, an echo of a death. Someone had died because of her. She knew his name: Henry. Like countless others in the ARCH, Jo knew nothing about him, if he had any family, where he had come from, or even where he’d worked. So many had come to the ARCH to be saved. So many banshees, so many dead. Young and old, strong and feeble, healthy and sick, the banshee had never discriminated and took randomly. Henry was another name on a memorial that would never be built. &nbsp;</p>



<p>A loud bell, a pair of girders welded together in a crude tuning fork, suspended from the roof in the middle of the atrium, rang dissonantly against the wind’s chorus. The shift bell rang every eight hours, in one, two, or three tones, indicating the shift number. Jo rose as did several in the room beyond, pulled on her pants and shirt, trudged down the hallway with others to pass through the toilet on the way to the dining hall. As she turned the corner and saw the lineup, she was unable to bring herself to get anything to eat, her empty stomach steadfastly warning her that food was not welcome. As others flowed around her, Jo stared into the distance. Jo was about to face her first tribunal.</p>



<p>As a member of the Council, Jo had participated in a few tribunals, taking the role of Lead Engineer when Erik was unwilling. She had heard the arguments, seen the evidence, considered the impacts, passed judgement. The first time had been deep nerves and near panic, the worry about false accusation and condemning the innocent. The second time, experience took root and helped her through the debates. By the fourth trial, the cold calculation of pro and con had regulated every question and response, and things seemed so much easier. There was no doubt the same methodical logic awaited as she approached the Council room.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Batesworth was already present, as was Erik. They nodded as Jo entered, Batesworth wordlessly indicating the seat Jo was to take. There were four seats, each spaced equidistant from the others. Batesworth and Erik remained standing for several more moments, until an older woman, a little wrinkled with some white in her otherwise black hair entered the room. Jo nodded at Agatha Reyes, the elected representative of the ARCH whom she’d met on previous trials. Reyes bore the scratches of scars of someone who had spent a lot of time in the tunnels, including a slightly limp from a rockfall. Reyes took the fourth chair; Batesworth and Erik then sat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This tribunal comes to order,” announced Batesworth. “I, Richard Batesworth, Leader of the ARCH—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’ve asked you to stop using that,” said Reyes. “It’s the worst form of classism.”</p>



<p>“Ms. Reyes,” Batesworth sighed, “we represent the three parts of the ARCH—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There is no one Leader,” Reyes said. “There is the People, and there are the Engineers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yes, and in a proper governance, there is a titular leader to—“</p>



<p>“What, lord over us?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even ensconced in her cloud of doom, Jo rubbed her face to fight off a rising smirk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Could we go with Elected, Engineer, and Founder?” Erik asked. “We did that last time.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“And as I have said—“ Batesworth caught the glare from Reyes. “—we will need this properly documented at a different time,” he muttered. “Joanna de Leon, you have been accused of gross negligence that lead to the death of Engineer Apprentice Henry Pelton. Before we begin with this assessment, do you disagree with this accusation?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No,” Jo said quietly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Very well,” said Batesworth. “Each of us have conducted interviews with the people who were present on the roof at the time, and we have taken these insights into account.” Batesworth turned to Reyes. “I call upon Ms. Reyes for the popular opinion.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>‘Popular’,</em>” Reyes snorted. “I talked with ten people, all of whom confirmed that Ms. de Leon had interrupted an impromptu Engineer meeting two days ago, and ordered twenty people outside. Eight of them went to the roof. The rest went out onto the valley floor. Both the crews on the roof and valley floor were unsupervised. Several saw Ms. De Leon distracted by something on the hill several times, not paying attention to the crews and their work. And she did not track the weather closely enough, leading to Mr. Pelton’s death. It is my opinion that, as an acting supervisor, Ms. de Leon was responsible for everyone’s actions and should have stayed on the roof and kept close watch on the conditions. Though I’m sure whatever it was that she went off to do was important, it could not have been more important than people’s lives. And when one of them was swept away due to her negligence, she chose to let a man die, rather than try to save him. It is the <em>popular</em>,” she glared at Batesworth for emphasis, “opinion that Ms. de Leon doesn’t have the ability to lead. We believe she should be stripped of her privileges and put into the general population.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Thank you, Ms. Reyes,” said Batesworth through his teeth. “Mr. Larsen, what is the Engineer opinion?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik looked at Batesworth, then at Reyes, before turning to Jo. Upon meeting her eyes, he stiffened and reddened, his mouth opened and closed without sound. Jo mouthed “it’s okay” to him. He nodded. “As you may recall, Professor Batesworth, that morning was chaotic. There were nearly forty people in the office, which made it impossible to hear or be heard. You and I were attempting to figure out work assignments with everyone arguing their priorities, when Ms. de Leon arrived and shouted us all down. I believe that is the interruption that Ms. Reyes referred to?” Reyes nodded. “Ms. de Leon then asked for five volunteers to come with her to the roof, and said we needed another ten to scrounge the canyon floor for anything we could use. Neither you nor I objected.” Batesworth nodded. “For whatever reason, Ms. De Leon’s actions got twenty-one volunteers, of which nine went to the roof. The remainder were sent to the canyon and told to bring back anything remotely useful. Given the conditions at the time, no-one thought to ask for any other instructions. Ms. De Leon went to the roof gave the volunteers clear instructions on how to walk safely, and stay away from sand traps. With them was Dawn Porter, an Engineer, who had experience with roof repairs and oversaw much of the activity there.” Erik took a deep breath before continuing, taking a quick glance at Reyes. “Ms. de Leon’s ulterior motive was to obtain a girder, which she was planning to use to brace the main struts under Block 4, which are showing serious deviation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reyes’ eyes shot open. “What?!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ms. Reyes,” said Batesworth calmly, “you will remember that this is a closed session, and anything you learn here must be kept secret.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That sounds like the ARCH is collapsing!!” Reyes shouted at Batesworth, who didn’t react. “Is it?!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It is moving,” said Erik. “Ms. De Leon recognized the problem and is working to prevent further slippage.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How <em>dare</em> you keep that from us!” shouted Reyes.</p>



<p>“<em>Agatha!</em>” snapped Batesworth. Reyes’ eyes burned in response. “There are plans to keep everyone safe. That is why the Engineers <em>exist</em>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You should have told us,” Reyes growled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Batesworth signed annoyedly. “To what end? Would that improve our situation at all? What we would have is mass panic. <em>That</em> is why you weren’t told.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Your classist distrust of us is sickening.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Batesworth ignored the insult. “Erik, please continue.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik nodded. “Jo— <em>Ms. de Leon</em> was moving girders to secure the struts and minimize further shifting. This is why Dawn Porter was charge. In addition to Ms. Porter, there were two other people with prior roof experience. Ms. de Leon and her assistant, Donner Vasquez, were working for roughly two hours to open a hole in the roof, move out the girder, close the hole, transfer the girder to the east side of the ARCH, and then move the girder to its current resting place under Block 4. They returned to the roof immediately afterwards. At that time, there was a near-accident on the roof, where volunteer Phyllis Bell slipped and fell into a sand pit. Ms. De Leon and her assistant were instrumental in helping Ms. Bell out of the pit, who was unharmed. I am told that Ms. Porter looked regularly for the weather conditions, which were calm and stable. I arrived on the roof about that time to inform Ms. de Leon that the people she’d taken to do repairs were being ordered to return to their scheduled shift work. She expressed her concern that she needed more time. I indicated that until Engineer Carl Young had finished discussions with you, Professor,” Erik nodded towards Batesworth, “she could continue to work. I then left. The wind started about two minutes later, by the time I had entered the atrium.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“And this is when Mr. Pelton died?” asked Batesworth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yes,” Reyes and Erik both replied.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“He was swept away in the wind,” said Reyes.</p>



<p>“Did Ms. de Leon make any effort to warn anyone?” asked Batesworth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As I understand, yes, she did,” said Erik. “She saw the storm approaching and called for everyone to get off the roof. Most of the people were fairly close to the door, and got inside before the wind picked up. However, Mr. Pelton and his partner, José Yerbin, were around the back of Block 8. It’s nearly a thousand yards back to the door.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“She let them get too far away from safety. They should have been secured with ropes,” said Reyes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They got within fifty yards of the door before the wind got too strong,” Erik continued. “Ms. de Leon ordered them to lay down. This is how Mr. Yerbin survived. However, Mr. Pelton did not lay down quickly enough and was blown off his feet. He rolled out of sight, several hundred yards away. Ms. de Leon tied a rope around herself and went out to retrieve Mr. Yerbin. Both of them sustained severe scrapes from the blowing sand. By the time Mr. Yerbin was safe, however, the sand was blowing so hard that it would have been fatal for anyone to go back out without protection.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“She performs repairs on the roof, doesn’t she?” Reyes demanded. “Why didn’t she retrieve the suit, and then go out after Mr. Pelton?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“An excellent question,” said Batesworth. “Is there anything else, Mr. Larsen?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In discussions with Francis Porter, the workshop manager, Ms. de Leon’s actions resulted in the acquisition of several hundred pounds of materials we can reuse for maintenance. Dawn Porter reported that weaknesses in the roof’s structure were found and repaired, which I have also verified. I can also add that the first girder added under Block 4 is in place and deformation on that strut has not changed. In my opinion, it is not clear that had anyone else spoken up that would would be able to say the same. That her decisions were supported implicitly by the other Engineers is important — no-one prevented her from carrying out those actions. We deeply regret Mr. Pelton’s death as a result of those decisions, but it is worth noting that Ms. de Leon was adamant that roof work was dangerous, and all Engineers are aware that going outside is very risky.”</p>



<p>Batesworth looked at Jo. “You’ve heard the opinions of the Populous and the Engineers. Do you have anything you wish to add?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I…” Jo gulped, the words retreated back. She shuffled in the heavily-worn seat, her chest heaving. Every facial muscle was engaged in a battle for expression, locked in an awkward stalemate with one another. She rubbed her throat and coughed lightly. She cleared her throat. “I wish things had happened differently.&nbsp; I wish I’d seen the storm sooner. I wish I had a longer rope.” She shook her head. “I wish we weren’t here.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You regret what you did?” asked Batesworth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo fought the knee-jerk reaction to respond, because she would have said “yes” without having actually thought it out. “No,” she said softly. “I can’t.” Reyes gasped. Jo met Reyes’s shock. “Because what I did will keep us all alive, at least for a while longer. Long enough that we’ll be safe.” Slowly, she felt a light brighten inside her darkness. She saw the landscape of her means, the color of its end. “I don’t like being responsible for someone’s death. It’s not something I want to carry for the rest of my life.” She looked up, and especially at Reyes. “But if that choice saves more lives than the one we lost, then it’s a responsibility I will take.” Reyes nodded curtly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Batesworth hummed for a few moments. “I think, Ms. de Leon, it’s fair to say that we will not absolve you of this accident.” He looked around and saw the nodding of both Erik and Reyes as confirmation. “You understand what happened, and that your decisions led to someone’s death. However, it was an accident and was not demonstrative of any malicious or premeditated intent. You are also remorseful of the event and its consequences.” Erik sighed quietly. Reyes continued to nod.</p>



<p>“Therefore,” Batesworth announced, “we find you innocent of the charge of murder, and must conclude that if there is any guilt, it’s from accidental manslaughter.” Erik groaned slightly.</p>



<p>Reyes looked at Batesworth. “What are you doing?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ms. De Leon, we cannot debate that your actions contribute to the whole, giving us at least another day upon this Earth. We would be foolish to consider banishment, but you must still face punishment for your inactions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Richard! We do not pass sentencing at tribunals!” Reyes barked. “Stop immediately!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We have the ability to provide a recommendation that the Council may hear,” said Batesworth without breaking his gaze at Jo. “As the Council is currently without a member, we are going to provide a final judgement to expedite our needs.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is not—!”</p>



<p>“Please, Agatha, let me finish,” said Batesworth. “Ms. De Leon, you are hereby removed from Council, though you will stay an Engineer. It will be made clear to everyone what happened, that you take responsibility for your actions. Further incidents where you attempt to take lead, however well-intentioned they may seem, will be immediately dismissed and any attempt to argue will incur further penalties. You will continue to report for maintenance issues, but you will report exclusively to Mr. Larsen for your assignments.” He turned to Reyes. “Is that acceptable, Ms. Reyes?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is not justice,” said Reyes. “You’re sweeping a problem under a rug.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“And what would you do, Agatha? Remove her entirely from supporting the roof over our heads? Allow more to be injured because Ms. De Leon is unable to react as swiftly?” Batesworth asked. “I have sat in many disciplinary meetings, they rarely end with everyone getting what they wish.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reyes grumbled and glared at Jo. “We’ll be watching.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’ll take that as agreement.” Batesworth turned to Erik. “And you, Mr. Larsen?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I agree,” said Erik, restraining a slight smile.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Batesworth stood. “Then this tribunal is adjourned.”</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Dust and sand sifted through the air alternately in loose particles, and in cascading rivulets collapsing under the force of gravity. The vacant space in Block 2 was trapped between an eerie emptiness and the angry rattle-bang of its exposed roof as the wind tried to rip the panels free. Atop a boulder centered in the chasm, Jo sat with her knees to her chin, staring at the canyon wall, as the dust settled upon her.</p>



<p>“Thought I’d find you here,” said Erik. He looked up from the base of the boulder, his hand blocking the settling sand. “May I join you?” he asked. A shoulder shrug was his answer. He climbed the boulder’s craggy parts and took an uncomfortable seat next to Jo. He shuffled a few times until the jagged parts of stone ceased trying to penetrate his ass. He looked around at the empty desolation. “You nearly died here, didn’t you?”</p>



<p>“Sí,” was the short reply. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m glad you didn’t,” he said. “Die, that is. Or even get hurt. How do you do that, anyway?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Do stupid things?” she mumbled through the crossed arms over her mouth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Not get hurt,” he said. Her eyes darted accusingly towards him a moment then returned to their stare. “Well, not physically, I mean. You fell, what 40 feet?”</p>



<p>“Maybe.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik shuffled again but said nothing else. The roof continued to act like a caged animal. His shoulders began to take on a reddish hue as the powder fell. “You’re not being banished,” he finally said.</p>



<p>“So.” Jo’s response was caught between a challenge and a dismissal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik opened his mouth and the start of something that would likely get him in trouble came out. He quickly shut up and rethought his point. “I know you were worried about banishment. That doesn’t make any of this any better, I know. I know… I … I don’t know how to … what else to say,” he trailed off. “Sorry, I don’t know why I came.” He started to slide off the boulder, but was caught by Jo’s hand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Stay,” she said. “Por favor.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik looked at Jo. “I want to ask if you’re okay, but that’s a stupid question, isn’t it?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No.” She straightened her back and dropped her knees. “I’m … I feel like this place.” She held out her arms to the vacancy of Block 2. “I don’t know what to do anymore, Erik. All I do is rush from disaster to emergency and try to help out and people…”</p>



<p>“Don’t care,” said Erik. “They don’t see it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Not until I kill someone.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Henry didn’t die because of you,” Erik said firmly. “Yes, he <em>died</em>, but not by any fault or intention of yours. You didn’t kill Henry, Jo. You didn’t force him out a door, or drop him off a roof, or throw him into the wind, or any of the things that anyone else has been opening their big mouth on. I ran into a lot of mouths who were convinced they knew the whole story and were trying to tell me how much they knew the facts. I think I nearly punched a couple of tunnelers when I was interviewing Dawn and they felt the need to tell me how you were the devil sent to kill us all—“ Erik stopped suddenly, his voice almost a shout in the space. He flushed and looked at Jo’s horror. “Oh. Oh my god, I’m so sorry, Jo, I didn’t mean to say that, I didn’t—”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo’s face softened and she placed her finger on Erik’s lips. “Esta bien, cariño. Thank you.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik’s confusing slid out from under his anger. “Uh, for…?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I know people have been badmouthing me. Carl apparently mouthed off to the guys in the workshop.” Tears seeped out and formed muddy trails down Jo’s face. “We’re going to die here.” She tried to wipe the wetness from her face but only succeeded in smearing the mud, creating streaks running from her nose almost to her ears. “This is pointless. None of what we’re doing matters. This place will collapse and kill us all.” She sniffed wetly. “What if we’re the last, Erik? The last humans? What if this is all that is left? When we’re gone, there will be no-one left to remember us.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re not going to die,” said Erik, softly. “Not here, anyway.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So we get buried alive in Carl’s deathtrap tunnels.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I still dream of being by the sea. A little cottage on a clifftop, overlooking a long, empty beach. Rolling surf, some seagulls, maybe a whale or two in the distance. Every evening, watch the sun set and the stars come out.” He touched Jo’s shoulder. “I want that to be real, Jo. I want to believe that we’re not here for any reason than to survive long enough to leave, get back to life somewhere else.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What if there’s nowhere else? How do we know that the world has been obliterated by the winds? Rich has never once picked up a radio transmission from anywhere. After all this time, wouldn’t others be trying to reach out, saying ‘we’re here’? We’re alone, Erik. We’re all that’s left.” She sniffed again. “And I don’t even know these people’s names.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No-one does, Jo,” said Erik. “You have any idea how long it took me just to find out Henry’s last name? We’re … all of us are like Block 2, Jo. We’re hollow, empty, destroyed by the wind that’s always trying to tear us apart. You can see our skeletons,” he pulled up his pant leg and showed his knee, his flesh so thin that it was possible to see the outline of the patella, “our life is as threadbare as it can get while still keeping us alive. Right now, this is all we have, this is what is keeping us alive long enough to get to the next place. Once we’re in the tunnels, we’ll start working out a step after that. One day, with luck, we’ll be somewhere else that is comfortable and safe.” He noticed the redness on his shoulder and brushed it off. “And a hell of a lot cleaner.” Jo burst a single laugh, a smile forced its way across her face. Erik reached out and touched her face. “That’s the Jo I know. You don’t give up. You fight. There’s no such thing as ‘hopeless’ to you. That’s why I…”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You what?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik reddened again. “I … admire you.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“‘Admire’,” Jo smirked. “Eres linda cuando tratas de decir que me amas. Espero que puedas decir eso algún día.”</p>



<p>“Huh?”</p>



<p>“Te amo mucho, cariño,” she said, giving Erik a quick peck on his cheek.&nbsp;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>“You were looking for me, Professor?” asked Carl as he entered Batesworth’s office.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You were supposed to be attending the tribunal,” said Batesworth, not looking up from the slates on his desk. “I gave you and Francis explicit orders to attend so we could deal with the Council decision immediately.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You said you wanted the tunnels opened,” said Carl. “We’ve been moving people in for the last two days. It’s taking every hand we have to get people moved and in place! Do you have any idea of how many beds—“</p>



<p>“Are you done with your pointless whining?” asked Batesworth. He rose from his chair to glare at Carl. “I gave you an order and I expect it to be followed.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>We are,</em>” said Carl. “Your order was to move people into the tunnels.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I told you to attend Jo’s tribunal!” Batesworth shouted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl stared for several moments. “Well, I didn’t. So what are you going to do about it?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I already did something,” said Batesworth. “You decided not to come, so I passed judgement.”</p>



<p>“Banishment?” Carl’s eyes gleamed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Batesworth made every move not to hide astonishment. “You are without a doubt the most callous person in here. If anyone should be banished for their behavior, perhaps it should be you!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“She killed a—!“</p>



<p>“No-one died by Jo’s hand!” Batesworth thundered. Carl cringed slightly. “Jo’s actions, whether you agree with them or not, will help the ARCH stand. That a person died is irrelevant. As I recall, you’ve had no less than a dozen deaths in the tunnels due to cave-ins, and so far you’ve never once sat at a tribunal to explain yourself.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Those are acciden—“</p>



<p>“Accidental deaths. Just like the one Jo witnessed when nature took its course. The only difference between Jo and yourself is that she took responsibility for it. You treat your tunnelers no different than batteries, throwing out the spent when they’re of no use to you.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I don’t have time to cry! We have lives to save!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There is always time to mourn the dead, Carl. Whether we know their names or not. Your callousness towards life is a liability here. I think you’ve been in the tunnels too long.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Professor, don’t—!”</p>



<p>“I think it’s time Dawn took over,” said Batesworth, his eyes drifting into thought. “She’s been in the tunnels a long time, she knows what’s going on, and given the state of their completion, she’s in a good position to ensure they’re finished properly.” Carl was speaking, but Batesworth couldn’t hear a thing. “Her experience with electrical and plumbing is perfect for this, actually. Then we can focus on getting the floors complete and make sure we get people in more quickly. I don’t know why I didn’t think of that sooner.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Professor!” Carl shouted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Hmm?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You can’t take me out, now, we are so close to having everyone set up with their own share of the space!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Share…,” Batesworth snapped his fingers. “That reminds me. Jo told me something about you allocating shares to the other Engineers. You’ve never brought this to Council, Carl. What are these ‘shares’ and what purpose do they serve?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl’s eyes twitched. “They’re, uh, we’re just making sure that we’re taking care of our own.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>How</em>, exactly?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Don’t you think it’s important for people to feel rewarded in their work?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“People are <em>alive</em>, Carl. Don’t you think that’s rewarding enough, given the conditions?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In here, sure,” Carl shrugged. “This place is going to fail.” Batesworth’s expression soured. “We’ve known this for months. That’s why we started tunneling! A safer place, more stable, more space for everyone. We’ll be comfortable! We can actually start having some civilization again, with better society and opportunity!” The sour sweetened, pushing Carl on. “So imagine if we rebalanced the equation again, Professor. When we started with the ARCH, it was just for us, the Engineers. We didn’t invite all these other people along for the ride, they forced their way in! They imposed themselves on us and we had to adapt to support them. We lost our personal spaces, we lost our advantage. We built this place and now we’re forced into corners because of them? How fair is that? Why can’t we make it better for us so that when we move into the tunnels, we take back our position as the chosen few?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“‘Chosen few’?” The sour returned. “To use Agatha’s term, that’s very classist, Carl. Why on earth do you want to do that. And as I recall, the only ‘<em>chosen</em>’ people here were my original class, all of whom were selected by <em>me</em>. If any classism exists here, it’s putting myself above you!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl’s mouth hung open. “Uh, well, of course we would naturally ensure that your share is … more …”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Amenable?” Batesworth proffered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yes,” Carl said slowly. “After all, you’re the Professor.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>Director</em>,” Batesworth corrected. “If we’re going to be changing things around here, I want to start with that.” Batesworth plunked himself in his chair and folded his arms, his eyes straying away again. “And this Council is done with. Once we’re moved in, we don’t need it. The ARCH will have served its purpose and the tunnels will support us. I’m tired of all the bickering, anyway.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Uh, Professor, I don’t think that’s a good idea.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We still need … governance. Your words, sir.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We <em>needed</em> governance. Now we need direction. And you are definitely not capable of that. None of you are. Once we’re in the tunnels, this will become an eminently different situation. In fact,” he faced Carl, “you’re going to ensure that my ‘share’ is at least … double of the other Engineers.” He chewed on the thought a moment. “Yes, reward is due, Carl. And you’re going to make sure that it’s set up that way.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Double?” Carl choked. “S-sir, I don’t think I can do that. I’ve … we’ve already set the formula and made promises—“</p>



<p>“Then unmake them,” said Batesworth coolly. “Come to think of it, Jo has been on maintenance now for at least three years. I think it’s time you two swapped places, and you can deal with the minor repairs.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl’s jaw clenched. “Double,” he agreed. “Hell, you deserve everything that’s coming to you, sir, why not make it triple?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Now, now, Carl, let’s not get greedy.” Batesworth swung around to his desk and riffled through a few slates, producing one that had long been smudged. He wiped it off and drew a box, filling it with a rectangle, circle, and a pair of architectural chair placeholders. “This should be appropriate, I think.” He held it arms’ length, admiring the look. Then he quickly added an alcove. “And my own private toilet.” He handed it to Carl. “Three days, and I move in.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl looked at the diagram. “I see.” He looked at Batesworth and smiled. “We’ll make it work.” &nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Jo laid on her bed and stared at the dully-lit ceiling, her lamp flickered unthreateningly. The winds were rising, the shrill harmonics of the banshee emerging like a creature from a foaming sea. The sense of pointless doom lingered from her conversation with Erik, punctuated by the shrieks from the wind. Was the banshee taunting her? Was it reminding her of a near-miss? Reyes wasn’t happy with the judgement, even less with the punishment. Had she been out for blood? Would she have demanded banishment? The thought sent a chill through Jo, despite the stagnant heat. Rescuing José Yerbin had been the first time she’d been in the sandstorms unprotected, the first time she’d seen their ferocity without the suit to protect her. Jo sat up in bed, clutching her chest, and tried to stop the feeling that someone was standing on top of her. She breathed heavily and deeply a few times before the sensation passed.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>What if we’re the last, Erik? The last humans?</em> Then who had been the woman on the hill? Did she live up there? There had only ever been four banishments from the ARCH and all of them had been men. Was she someone who wanted in? She hadn’t looked desperate for help, or even remotely upset. She’d waved back like … she was dreaming. And even though she’d seen the storm coming, she hadn’t panicked like everyone else.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo lay back down, gently, just in case she needed to leap back up again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik had defended her. He’d sidestepped the glaring faults in her thought process and reactions. He could have easily brought up the fact that she hadn’t brought the suit up, just in case the wind picked up. He could have said that she hadn’t bothered to get ropes, even if just to help crossing the roof. He could have faulted her for leaving the roof unsupervised. Sure, Dawn was there, but Dawn was never a supervisor — she was book smart when it came to structural engineering; her expertise was with electrical. Not that Jo was any expert in structure, for that matter, she’d nearly flunked the class.</p>



<p>Batesworth had played the judge, like he always did. In a way, he was the best impartial judge there was: he saw himself being above everyone else, anyway, so he didn’t really feel attachment to anyone. It was a wonder he hadn’t completely lost himself in the ARCH. He’d lost his family, his career, and no-one was going to remember any of his achievements — they’d all been destroyed during armageddon. There would be no permanent monuments to his name.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet, somehow, he’d pressed forward in the ARCH. Jo didn’t know how. She wasn’t sure anyone knew how. Jo blinked, realizing for the first time that she herself had no clue what drove her forward. Existence? Presence. Being. There were many synonyms for their state, all of them being the antonym for “death”. There was no betterment of human life, no preservation of the environment, no new discoveries. Nearly the equivalent of being blown back to the Dark Ages, with only the knowledge of metallurgy, electricity, and mechanics to really differentiate them from the serfs of old.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And Jo was now a serf. She had lost her privileges. She wasn’t on the Council anymore. No more priority ration. She still had the keys to the Engineering spaces, but that was of little real benefit beyond her access for maintenance. The only reason she still had her cot is that Batesworth had forgotten that she’d had any room to speak of, Reyes simply didn’t know, and Erik had conveniently overlooked it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The banshee hit a crescendo and the structure vibrated like a washing machine on its spin cycle. Jo looked at her pager. It hadn’t gone off. The roof repairs seem to have at least paid a benefit, rather than being a painful deficit of life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She got up, and pulled on her clothes and boots. There wasn’t any point in pretending to try to go sleep.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The hallways were mostly awake, even if its eyes were mostly closed. Somewhere off in the atrium, a baby wailed in harmony with the wind. For a moment, Jo said a prayer and thanked Whomever for … well, whatever it was that kept people from procreating. It wasn’t fair to bring a child into this world, not now, not before there was at least some sense of security. The ARCH was a deathtrap, not a place for people to have comfort or safety or peace or … anything beyond not dying.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How had the parents even had sex in the first place? Apart from the privacy for intimacy, there was the general lack of desire. Everyone complained about it. There was something about being in the ARCH that seemed to neuter without the finality of surgery. Too many people, the constant droning, the fear of the banshee, the food, the smell, the fact that nearly every woman had turned to the same cycle… Jo shook her head. She couldn’t even remember the last time she’d had sex. She was fairly sure it had been somewhere out in the desert one night, shortly after the class had erected ARCH 1. There’d been a party … who had she gone out with?&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Ten years.</em> Jo twisted her neck around, and tried to forget how tired she felt. She was sleepy, but couldn’t sleep; hungry, but could never eat enough; exhausted and never got enough rest; worried and without…</p>



<p><em>Hope</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo rested on a railing on the stairwell, looking into atrium. It moved restlessly, creaks coming from every direction as people tossed in their bunks. The floors were covered with those unable to find a place to sleep, and others padded around, stuck in same torpor as Jo. &nbsp;</p>



<p>She felt old, far older than her body’s age. A decade under the roof, a decade of forced labor and fear. A decade of poor food and threshold dysentery. Her skin was dry, her hair a constant mess.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Was this hope? Was this their future? The bottom of the fall from grace, a pause in time until a rebuild could begin? No-one knew. Philosophers were few, and generally unwanted. Reality was too harsh for people to be asking “what if?” when there were a few hundred thousand pounds of metal and sand waiting to crush you. Patience was as thin as everyone’s worn-out clothing.</p>



<p>Was it hopeless? Jo looked out into the atrium, and in a rare moment, tried to see individuals, instead of the collected masses. A child sat, awake and upset, but not crying. He didn’t seem to want anything, though it was clear he wasn’t happy. He looked about, though seemingly not to look for anything in particular.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A man stumbled about, his leg injured and wrapped with an old shirt. His clothes were a dusty red, as was his hair. A miner, a tunneller, a victim of a rockfall, who hadn’t showered since his injury.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A blonde-haired woman had curled up next to a balding man, against the back of one of the sleeping racks. She had her hand wrapped over his chest. A sense of security, of familiarity, of togetherness, with a touch of desperation.</p>



<p>Jo looked down at the people around her on the stairwell landing. They were the same faces, the same looks, the same feelings. Why had she not seen it all before? Maybe she had, but not recognized it. Or she didn’t want to. Focus on the work: build the ARCH, repair what’s broken, keep the ship afloat at all costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Make mistakes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mistakes hurt. They came in different shapes and severities, but they all hurt. Given, she didn’t feel remotely as bad about changing a light for one that was defective, as opposed to leading someone to their doom. Even the small ones stung, and those stings built up over time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She’d let someone die.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The thought kept coming back. It hadn’t been a mistake, it had been a deliberate action. She had <em>chosen</em> not to try and save a life. Reyes had been right; Erik had avoided mentioning anything. He had protected her.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Above, the banshee wailed into a sudden scream.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The lights flickered and across the atrium, darkness swallowed everything. Jo frantically dug into her pants, searching for the light. With shaking hands, she managed to turn it on. The batteries were low and the glow was dim. She unfolded the handle and wound frantically until the darkness abated around her. Only then did she realize that the blackout had caused everyone else to be concerned, the sounds of cries and moans from around the atrium and within the hallways.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A light!” said several voices from deep in the blackness. “What’s going on?” said a few more. “Who’s that? Are they here to help?” A few children cried for their parents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Feeling her stability returning, Jo slowly started to descend the stairs, picking her way around several people who begged her to stay with her light. She could hear others moving around out of view. The structure of the ARCH creaked as the wind howled. The floors clanked as people tried to find their way in the impenetrable dark, followed shouts as they tripped and fell on the unseen. Even though the atrium was a massive open space, it felt like she was falling into a black funnel, coming every closer to its narrow and confining tip.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Jo!” called a voice from somewhere ahead of her. It echoed amidst the other voices, making it difficult to determine who it was, or even the person’s sex. The voice, however, offered a destination and support, urging her to move more quickly. It was only a few moments before she nearly landed in Phil’s arms, which were outstretched so Phil could avoid such collisions. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Phil!” breathed Jo. “How’d you know it was me?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’re the only one who carries a light,” he snarked in the dark. “The power’s out all over. I think a main breaker must’ve tripped.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo felt cold, even in the heat. “Great, another one.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>They hustled through the hallways, as quick as they could given the increasing crush of people who were also searching for light, until they were tucked into one of the Engineering hallways. They wound more quickly, following the sounds of other voices, all of whom seemed to be headed to the same place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As they rounded the final corner, the voices all began to stop. In their stead was an apprehensive murmuring and the sound of retching. Phil sniffed tentatively. “Is someone cooking … <em>beef?</em>”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When was the last time you saw meat, Phil?” asked someone else further ahead. “That’s not beef. Can’t you smell the hair? The ozone?” Both Jo and Phil froze. They could smell it. It was strong. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Who… who is it?” asked Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Don’t know,” said another voice, “don’t have a light.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even though Jo couldn’t see them, she knew every eye was trained on her. She walked slowly to the breaker room, but could only stare at the handle, knowing that inside, someone had died. “Um, anyone else want to look?” she asked. There was no offer. Jo wanted to take a deep breath to steady herself, but the stench was so strong near the door that she didn’t dare. The keys were in the lock, keys she already recognized. She pushed the door open slowly, and shone her light just past the door’s edge. The door had to open the entire way before she could make out anything that wasn’t a wire, conduit, railing, or box. It wasn’t hard to determine which had been human. Jo gasped and dropped her light. It landed on the floor, bounced once, and tipped up on its end, casting its light upwards onto Jo’s face.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Who is it?” someone asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There was no mistaking the body. The greyed, though singed hair; the well-kept, though partly-melted clothing. Jo’s eyes swelled and she coughed at the sulphurous smell. She stumbled out of the room, and fell against the hallway wall.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Who?!” asked someone else.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s… Batesworth.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">“What do we do?” someone asked. It was probably Bonnie, but Jo didn’t look to confirm. It didn’t matter. They were all on the floor, partly having their strength sapped by the sudden news, partly to avoid the overpowering stench.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We have to get the lights back on,” said someone else.</p>



<p>“How? We don’t know what’s wrong in there! The Professor died from it! I don’t want to die from it!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We can’t see where we’re going. We can’t grow food without light, and we can’t cook the food without heat. We’ve got to fix what went wrong.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s dangerous!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You want us all to suffer because you’re scared?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yes, I’m scared! You should be, too!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Woman up, the both of you!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I <em>am</em> a woman! I’m perfectly fine—“</p>



<p>“Then stop wimping out!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nearly everyone was shouting in short order. Jo just stared at her light, still sitting on the floor aimed at the ceiling. The batteries were slowly starting to die again, the hallway dipping deeper into darkness. No-one else seemed to notice. Jo wanted to get the light, wind it up again, keep the light going. But she couldn’t move.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The banshee cackled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What’s going on?!” boomed Erik’s voice. He had finally arrived from wherever he had been. The hallway went silent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Batesworth is dead,” someone finally said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik’s voice was a hoarse whisper. “What?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“He was electrocuted,” Jo whispered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik carefully stepped around his seated comrades, and looked around the door. He gagged, and swung back into the hall. “Oh, god!” He slid down the wall to the floor. “How…?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We don’t know,” said Phil. “He was already dead when Jo opened the door.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What do we do?” the same person asked again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik swallowed. “Uh…” He fought for purpose, for an action. “Um.” He fought against his mind’s wish to collapse. “We’ve got to get the power back on.” He finally said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“See, I told you!” someone sneered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Shut up!” another shouted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Quiet!” Erik hissed. “We’ve got to get the power back on. We can’t survive without electricity. We need to fix whatever broke … whatever killed the Professor. We … uh … we have to get in there. That means we need to remove his body.” Everyone went quiet, knowing what would come next.</p>



<p>“You mean … dump it?” Jo asked. There were few things you could do with a corpse in the ARCH. There was no available land for a graveyard, burial outside was nearly impossible due to the winds, there was no freezer to preserve remains.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No,” said Erik, shaking his head in the dimming light. “We can’t. Not him. We <em>need</em> to bury him. A memorial to his work. To this place.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Where? In the greenhouse?” someone balked. Someone else restrained a gag.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We can’t go outside!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The tunnels? We could seal him up at one end…”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Someone snorted. “I don’t want to be near that, do you?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Derision turned to shouting turned to name-calling. The hallway reverberated with argument, fingers thrown in the long, dim shadows, the shapes turning into a legion of demons swarming around the deceased. They stood, close to one another, yelling and fighting, all trying to usurp the decision to their favor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo, still seated, raised her hand. It remained up, barely lit, for over a minute before someone noticed. They quietened, as did the person next to them. The hush spread out like ripples in a pond until everyone waited for Jo to speak. When the last person went silent, she lowered her hand.</p>



<p>“Block 2,” said Jo. “I know just the spot.”&nbsp;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Removing Batesworth’s body had taken several strong people with stronger stomachs. His flesh had been burned, his body effectively cooked by the voltage that had surged through the wiring. Pieces of it had stuck to the railing he had been gripping, his hair had shed like pieces of charred paper. Their senses, long accustomed to a vegan diet, also had difficulty processing the scent of flesh.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Opting not to announce the accident to the ARCH’s population, the Engineers squirrelled Batesworth’s corpse to the lowest levels before taking it over to the base of Block 2. Using some scraps of wood and sticks that had been scrounged from outside, they made torches, lighting the way to Block 2 and allowing the other Engineers trapped in other parts of the ARCH to follow. Other torches were left in the atrium on the opposite side to turn curious eyes from following the funeral procession.</p>



<p>The drag lines from Jo’s body, where Donner had saved her from the sand, were still plainly visible. It took over an hour of continuous digging by four people — mostly to keep sand from falling back — to excavate a three foot deep hole; they could dig no deeper before hitting more rock. While they dug, Smiley chipped away on one of the boulders. Jo and Dawn built a small fire with sticks and scraps of wood to give off enough light for them to assemble.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Should we make a coffin?” asked Bob, as the gravediggers stood over their work. “I mean, he shouldn’t be buried just like this … right?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We don’t have the material,” said Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We should at least cover him with a sheet,” Phil offered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You have one handy?” asked Erik. Phil shook his head. “We’ll cover him with sand before bringing the others in. They don’t need to see him like this.” He looked at his mentor. “I wish we hadn’t.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Professor Batesworth was laid in the grave, his body covered with sand, before the rest of the Engineering team was brought in. Their shadows danced along the rough walls of Block 2, swaying like palm trees in an evening breeze. They assembled around the memorial, taking a moment to see what Smiley had carved into the rock:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Here lies Professor Richard Batesworth, Founder of the ARCH, Saviour of Souls”, and the date: “Died September 22, 2031”.</p>



<p>There was a discomfort beyond the funeral, beyond the sting of death. They shuffled in the sand, rustling their hands in their pockets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How old was he?” came a voice. It was Donner. “Shouldn’t there be a birth date?” The discomfort became palpable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We don’t know when he was born,” said Erik. “Not even his birthday.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The only sound was the Banshee above, and the crackling of the small and dying fire. There wasn’t a sniffle, not a single sob or sigh.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Someone should say something,” whispered Dawn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All eyes turned to Erik. He didn’t have to look to know, nor did he have to feel the begging stares. He clasped his hands and thought back to every obligation, calling, wedding, funeral, cotillion, graduation, baptism, confirmation, eucharist, bris, bar and bat mitzvah he’d ever attended. For a moment, his history went as blank as the rock before him: only the death that had just occurred.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Professor Batesworth was my teacher for many years, as he was for many of you. He was our mentor, our guide. His vision has allowed us to survive,” Erik said, his voice echoing in the high walls of Block 2’s empty shell. “I wish I could tell you more about him. But I can’t. He was a private man, who tried to lead a private life, even here. I saw him more than most, but even then it was always professional.” Erik humphed and smiled. “He was always professional. He refused to be anything else. He gave me my ring and reminded me of its importance, its meaning. To him, it was everything.” Erik looked around at the group. “And, maybe, that’s what has really kept us alive.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The tiny fire kept burning, kept smouldering, until after a few more minutes, only the glowing embers cast a painfully weak light. “We need to get the power back on,” said Erik quietly.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">“Dawn, I need you in the breaker room. Jo, you too. You’ve got the only working light. Everyone else, take some of this wood with you, find a place to build a small fire, and try to give these people some hope while we get the lights back on.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo came close to Erik. “Erik, we need know what happened.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I know,” he replied. “Do you think we need a couple of more eyes?”</p>



<p>“You know what Rich would be saying right now,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Bob!” called Erik. “And Phil! I need the both of you, too.” The two men stopped the exit and returned, everyone huddled in. “I need two things done. First, we need to find out — <em>quickly</em> — how Rich got electrocuted. We can’t be exhaustive, so I want anything that stands out, called out. Once we’ve got a decent idea, we can worry about rewiring.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Does Francis have any more of that wiring?” Jo asked Dawn.</p>



<p>“I took the last spool of the heavy gauge,” said Dawn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’ve got some in the emergency supply,” said Bob.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’ve got an ‘emergency supply’?” asked Erik. “Why the hell don’t I know about this?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There hasn’t been an emergency,” shrugged Phil.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik refrained an outburst. “Bob, go get that wire, please?” asked Erik. “Take a torch. We’ll meet you in the breaker room.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tormented souls had filled the inside of the ARCH in the time it had taken to dig Batesworth’s grave and bury him. Howls, shrieks, moans, and inhuman wailing leaked from the darkness, even though the doors and walls that separated the Engineers from everyone else. The sound came from every direction, seeping through the walls, floors, ceiling, railings, doors, sockets, and fixtures in a auditory ooze. Jo’s skin crawled the entire walk back to the breaker room. The banshee had found company with the ARCH’s inhabitants and taught them well.</p>



<p>Erik, Dawn, Phil, and Jo started where they had found Batesworth. His hand print — and a bit of his skin — remained on the railing. His other hand had been pressed onto a breaker box on the wall. They looked around the box, seeing burned wire casing, signs of melting and arcing. The box was nearly welded shut from the amperage that had coursed through it, and opened only with considerable protest. The inside was a mess of blackened plastic and half-melted metals, nearly unrecognizable from its original state.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Holy cats,” Dawn breathed. “I thought this was bad the last time. How the hell did this happen? You’d need to have had … do we even <em>generate</em> this much juice?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The wind’s blowing hard,” said Phil. “The turbines could’ve hit their max…”</p>



<p>“There’s breakers to prevent that,” Dawn countered quickly. “The only way this could have happened is if…” Dawn turned to Jo. “This was the same box we worked on last time, right?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo suddenly felt very defensive. “Yes, but—“</p>



<p>“We tested it, I know,” said Dawn. She turned back to the box. “And we still goofed. I nearly killed you, remember?” Phil looked surprised. “We doubled a wire by mistake.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“And I’m fine, thank you,” added Jo. “We fixed this. We went over it two more times before we turned it all on again.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>“So where’s the fault, Dawn?” asked Erik.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phil leaned in close and looked closely. “Someone shorted the breakers. They wanted as many amps as they could get. Whatever they were doing, it was intense.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yup,” Dawn nodded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Who needs that much power?” asked Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Francis,” said Phil and Jo simultaneously. Dawn continued: “His smelter is electric. That’s why the lights dim when he turns it on.”</p>



<p>“Has it been on a lot lately?” asked Erik.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dawn shrugged her shoulders. “I don’t know, Erik. I’ve been in those stupid tunnels.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Phil?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phil shook his head. “Yeah, a lot. I … I think he’s tried to run it hotter to everything done. He’s been complaining that it was too cold. I don’t know for sure, I’ve been running stuff between the shop and the tunnels.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Another accident,” Erik muttered. “Okay, what do we do? I want a longer investigation, but we need the lights back on.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We have to replace this panel,” said Dawn, whacking it with her hand. “Everything’s shot. And unless you got one hiding in your pants, we’re going to have to steal someone else’s.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How many breaker panels do we have?” asked Erik.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Four,” said Dawn, jerking her thumb further into the room, past the wiring racks. “Two of them deal with all the lights, one handles the kitchen. The fourth is unused; we disconnected it when we reduced the number of lights. And before you say anything, that one is too small to handle all of this. We’ll need a second one.”</p>



<p>“Or we rewire all the panels to free up a bigger one,” suggested Erik.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo tried to offer an idea. “So what—“</p>



<p>“We build a bridge out of scrap metal, isolate it, and hardwire one of the light panels using it. It means that those lights won’t be on breakers, but unless someone does something <em>monumentally</em> stupid, it’ll do.” Dawn stood with her arms crossed, daring a challenge. She didn’t receive one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bob burst in the breaker room, a large hand-wound spool of thick wire slung over his shoulder. “Got the wire!” he smiled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How much grief did Francis put up over that?” asked Erik cautiously.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“None,” said Bob. “He wasn’t there.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Good,” said Dawn, taking the wire from Bob. “Then he won’t know we’re using it. Any chance you grabbed side cutters?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yep!” Bob beamed, pulling out a well-used pair from his back pocket. “And these!” He pulled out a heavy cable cutter, the sort of tool that made everyone want to tuck their fingers away for safety.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’re the man, Bob!” Dawn cried, wielding the cable cutter like a broadsword. “Jo, shine that light over here?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dawn started cutting all the larger wires, freeing the box from its confinement on the wall. It had barely hit the floor when Phil scooped it up and hauled it away for recycling. Bob started unspooling the new wire and separating the old wiring to accommodate two panels. Dawn and Jo went towards the back of the room to free up one of the two lighting panels, while Erik and Phil hacked together a metal frame that would support the electrical distribution for the lights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo’s wrist had started to hurt considerably after winding the light for an hour. They tapped the next Engineer foolish enough to walk by to take over, while Jo lent her hand helping Dawn set up the new panels. They took a break only when Erik and Phil were ready to wire up the frame for the lights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The power had been off for close to six hours before Dawn was finally happy with their new configuration to brave turning the power back on. She checked the breakers, carefully marked with Dymo embossed labels (from an embossing tool kept in the breaker room that was self-labelled as: “Remove under penalty of death”), took a deep breath, and muttered: “Hold onto your butts.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>There were a series of loud clunks as the electrical connections were made to the turbines on the roof, and to the battery bank that provided light for the few times the wind didn’t blow, and the lights flickered back into being.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The cheer started low, then began to grow, until it was a thunderous revelation akin to a Hollywood moment when the world was saved from imminent devastation. None of the people in the room celebrated, instead staring at all the new wiring, separated boxes, and the new hard-wired frame that gave all of them more than a few worries. No smoke appeared, and at a hand’s span away, nothing was emitting enough heat to worry anyone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This sucks,” said Dawn, staring at her work, and the rest of the room. “What I wouldn’t give to rip this room out and redo it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It just has to last until we get into the tunnels, Dawn,” Jo reminded her. “Then you can gut this place.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I still want to know what happened,” said Erik. “Let’s remember that Rich died in here.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We all want to know,” said Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Bob, I want you and Phil looking this over in detail. All of it. Dawn and Donner’s tribunal will take place tomorrow, and we need evidence.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>Donner?!</em>” Jo blurted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>ME?!</em>” added Dawn.</p>



<p>“Why the hell are you putting them on trial?!” demanded Jo.</p>



<p>Erik looked hard at Jo and avoided Dawn. “You think I want to? You know the rules, Jo. You know—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You can’t do this! You have no proof it was them! They were fixing—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Rich is dead, Jo!” Erik sounded more like was pleading than being forceful. “We have to investigate. We have to have an answer for what happened. And at the moment, the last people known to have touched all this are Dawn and Donner. You witnessed that, right?” Jo offered nothing in response. “Let Bob and Phil do their job, and maybe they’ll be able to determine what actually happened.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’re putting an innocent people on the firing line,” Jo protested.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If they’re innocent, then nothing will happen and we move forward. But if there is something — even if it’s a mistake — we still have to understand what happened,” Erik persisted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo pressed close to Erik and spoke low. “I don’t trust Bob and you know it. Don’t them scapegoat anyone. Don’t make me regret holding out for you.” She turned and left the room, leaving a very puzzled Erik behind.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Jo was banned from the tribunal. She had protested. Erik had argued. Reyes had humphed. And Bob had blocked the door, keeping Jo from being even within earshot of the closed door. Jo wasn’t worried that Dawn or Donner wouldn’t get a fair trial; as much as Reyes tended to be harsh, Erik tended to be light, and Erik had agreed to put Bonnie on the Tribunal instead of Francis or Carl. Where Bob’s priorities fell was another matter and it wasn’t clear if his findings would be biased, but somehow Jo’s gut said not to panic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, she couldn’t sit in the hallway outside the Engineer’s Office. Being unable to listen or act on anything she heard led her to pacing a short distance in front of the door for a few minutes before finally marching off to keep her mind occupied doing something else.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo went to the stairs to head down to the greenhouse to talk with Anita. Only when she got to the bottom, she stopped. With a terse sigh, she climbed back up to the hallways. But what to do? The inability to talk to either Donner or Dawn, or Erik for that matter, closed off most of her readily available sources of information. While the gardeners were always a welcome distraction, they worried about food, not about structures or electrical circuits…&nbsp;</p>



<p>The answer to Jo’s need to investigate came like a break in the clouds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The breaker room looked the same as she had last seen it. An odor that was a conglomerate of copper, hamburger, sulphur, and plastic still hung in the room, coated onto the boxes and wires and railings and floor. Jo tried not to think of where the smells had come from and focused instead on what had happened. Or possibly had happened. The room had been purged of evidence, and repairs already conducted to keep the place functioning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What had Batesworth been doing? Why had he come into the room in the first place? Had he come into fix something? Had a light gone off? Jo thought carefully about how she had seen Batesworth the day before, trying to replace his corpse with a mental mannequin. She walked to where he had been found. He had been standing, his muscles having been seized into place, keeping him upright. One hand was on a railing, the other on the panel box. The panel box that Dawn had removed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The one that Phil had taken to the shop to be recycled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo ran to the workshop, as fast as one could run through a place with completely overcrowded spaces. The door to the workshop was closed and locked. Jo knocked on the door three times, getting no answer. Having no key to the door, Jo pulled out her multitool.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Separating it into two parts, Jo unfolded two very thin rods, one on each section. What the rods were originally intended to do had long since been forgotten; they were now whatever they needed to be. She inserted both into the lock and quickly started to rake the tumblers. She jiggled one rod while pressing down with the other. She listened intently for the sounds of something giving way. Fortunately, everything in the ARCH was loose after so many years of use, and locks were no different. A clicking, combined with a turning of the tumbler, revealed her success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She entered quietly and carefully, thinking about the act she was carrying out. Why was she sneaking around, anyway? She had as much of a right to be there that Francis did, after all. Except for the supposed demotion, anyway. Her privileges were gone. She was still an Engineer, but Francis would certainly be angry with her breaking into the workshop “without reason”. Would he care if she said she was looking for the panel box? Francis would bring it up in Council. The others would push to have Jo restricted even further, or kicked out altogether. She closed the door carefully and relocked it.</p>



<p>The workshop was deserted. Jo could feel heat from the smelter, which was roaring up to its next job. She darted over to the collected piles of scrap metal, most of which looked like it had come from outside, but was unable to find the panel box. She checked the other shelves and cubbies, in the chance it had been stored in a different location. The box was nowhere to be seen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The small door on the side with the heavy bolt attracted Jo’s attention. She had seen Francis exit the door a few days earlier. The lock was old and worn, like the bolt that had kept the workshop door closed. She pulled out her multitool again. Though a bit more stubborn than the main door’s lock, it could not resist Jo’s technique and soon popped open.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The room beyond the door was larger than Jo had expected for such a small portal, measuring roughly fifteen feet by four feet, going well into the rockface. Every wall was a heavy shelf, leaving only a narrow space in the middle. The shelves were nearly filled with old crates, which refused to budge when she tried to move them, and clinked when jostled. She opened the lid to one of them, reached in and pulled out a small metal coin that glinted a bright yellow even in the low light of the room. “¿Que es esto? ¿Una moneda? ¿Por que tienes monedas, Frank?” She pocketed the coin and replaced the lid. She searched the other shelves, looking for the panel box. The variety of stocked items quickly blurred as her urgency rose: tools, wire, metal bars, wood blocks, blobs of mould wax, fabric, broken blades, crucibles, mismatched and heavily patched gloves, face shields, helmets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The workshop doors clanged as they were being opened. Jo burst from the small room, quickly closing the door. There wasn’t time to slide the bolt back and lock it. She paused only long enough to decide whether to go back into the room and hide, and not know if she was going to be found, or hide behind something else. As someone came through the doorway, the decision became moot and Jo dived behind the only thing large enough to shield herself: the smelter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The smelter was a large machine, easily able to hide two or three people behind it, mounted on heavy triangular frames that allowed the cauldron to pivot. The cauldron was roughly tear-shaped, with the thin end blunted, being an opening for loading and unloading. The cauldron roared as great fans blew in air to heat the insides and form a protective layer to keep the molten metal from melting out the sides. The unit produced horrific heat. Even with her shirt shielding her face, it felt like it was burning like a blowtorch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Several people walked into the workshop. The smelter blocked almost all view, which kept Jo hidden but also kept her from seeing who had arrived. She carefully turned and peered around the side, and caught glimpses of Francis, Phil, Bob, two other Apprentices on Francis’s crew … and Carl. Each of them had carried a large plastic bin, which they heaved onto one of the tables. Even though the roar of the smelter’s blowers had drowned out most of the sound, she could feel the thumping through the floor. Whatever they held, it was heavy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They talked about something. Whatever it was, she couldn’t hear. And try as she may, Jo couldn’t read lips. Then Francis pointed to the small room she had left unlocked. The others turned. Despite her skin boiling, she felt frozen. Then Francis pointed to the smelter and everyone turned again. Jo disappeared behind the machine and bumped into something. It hadn’t been attached to the smelter, as it moved when she hit it. She glanced around, and spied the panel box that had been removed from the breaker room. She shuffled on her hands and knees to face it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Suddenly, the smelter moved, its electric motors whirring as it tilted the massive cauldron down. Peering just underneath, Jo saw a mould being kicked into place. Someone was wearing heavy protective clothing — at least from the knees down, which was all she could see — and positioning things carefully. The base of the cauldron, carrying the duct work for the blowers, started to press Jo into the wall as it came closer and closer. The ducts were heavy and glowed a dull red from the heat. Jo could feel her skin wanting to burn and blister and her clothes were painfully hot. She could smell her hair starting to singe. The cauldron slowly stopped and the mould was adjusted. The motors whirred again, lowly, and the cauldron crept further horizontal, then dipped just beyond horizontal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A thin stream of bright liquid poured down into the mould, a shiny, glowing reddish-yellow. The pour lasted only a moment or two before the cauldron was tipped back up, and returned to its former position. The mould was pulled away with a rod. Jo spun around again and tried to peer around the corner. Sweat was pouring over her face, and seeing anything clearly was difficult. She could see Francis, dressed in his protective clothing, and Carl looking into the mold, nodding appreciatively. The others had apparently left.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl said something, Francis responded and started to remove his protective clothing, putting it on the table next to the crates. Then the two of them headed back towards the door and left. Jo waited only a moment before diving back out from behind the smelter, falling flat onto the floor. For the first time in years, she felt genuinely cold. Still not wanting to get caught being in the workshop, she couldn’t enjoy the feeling for long. She rolled up, and … paused.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She wanted to look at the panel box, her reason for being in the workshop. But her curiosity begged her to look at whatever it was that had been poured in the mold, and what had been brought in the crates. Her paranoia won, and she first checked to make sure the door was locked. She could at least hear it being turned, and would hopefully gain a few seconds to hide again if someone returned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Curiosity came next, starting with the crates. They were filled with what looked like dirt: small rocks, bits of dried soil, flecks of quartz. She sifted her hands through it, unable to parse why they’d bothered to bring such junk to the workshop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She turned her attention to the mold, still sitting on the floor. It was still hot, radiating out the heat that had melted whatever it was that had been poured into the mold. Inside, she saw a bright yellowy metallic surface, which had started to loose some of its lustre as it cooled. She remembered the coin she had taken from the small room. She dug it out of her pocket, and saw it clearly in the brighter light of the workshop. There was no mistaking what she held. <em>“</em>¿Oro?”A thought crossed her mind and Jo returned to the crates, digging through two of them before finding a tiny little yellow nugget. “Están extrayendo oro.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>They found gold in the tunnels, presumably. Gold was an excellent conductor and could be spun into wires. With copper in such short supply and the need for a lot more wiring, it made sense. It would be a strangely luxurious resource to use, but it would be effective. The coins would be a convenient way of storing the gold before being worked into something thinner. And given the historical value of the commodity, the security was understandable. Jo nodded to herself. “Buena idea, Frank.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Curiosity sated, Jo returned to the panel box. In the brighter light, it was easier to see the melted and burned plastic, the pieces of wire that had nearly exploded under the severe voltage. Ground zero, where the arcing had been most severe, seemed to almost come from the back of the box. She tried to pull out some of the breakers to get a better look, but the ones blocking her view were fused right into the box’s distribution frame. She flipped the box over, in hopes the back might have melted off.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It hadn’t. Instead, she found a rough hole, looking almost torn open, about three inches square. She peered through the back and saw the rails on which the breakers were mounted, which were heavily distorted from heat. A thick mass of shiny copper laid across four of the breakers, effectively connecting them into a single unit. Had that been the source? <em>&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Jo flipped the box back over and saw bits of material caked to the surface of the melted breakers. She was about to pick some of it away when she realized what it was: parts of Batesworth’s hands. The outline of a handprint was clearly visible. It had been his right hand, the outline showing the clear gap where his engineer’s ring had been. She followed the outline to figure out where the forefinger had been. The breaker had been melted away, but it was clear that Batesworth had been attempting to reset something when he’d been killed. She flipped the panel back over again and matched up the shorted breakers with the one Batesworth had touched. It was then she realized that the short would only have taken effect if the breaker was turned back on.</p>



<p>Opting not to run, Jo returned to the breaker room casually, as if she were going about her regular duties. Opening the door to the breaker room, she nearly ran right into Erik, who was in the act of exiting the room. “Erik!” she blurted, jumping. “What are you doing here?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik looked at Jo. “I should ask the same thing.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo looked at Erik. She closed the door behind her. “I’m trying to find out who sabotaged the panel,” she said quietly.</p>



<p>“So am I,” said Erik.</p>



<p>“You are? But, how—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Dawn said she’d found it during her investigation,” said Erik, “but didn’t say anything with everyone around. She told me that she’d found a heavy wire at the back of the panel before Phil took it away. She didn’t get a chance to look at it closely, but she thought it might be the cause.”</p>



<p>“It was.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What? How do you know that?”</p>



<p>“I broke into the workshop,” Jo confessed. “I looked at the panel box. I found the same thing. It looked like someone put it there with a hatchet.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You <em>broke </em>in?”</p>



<p>“No-one was there and I didn’t have a key!” Jo protested. “I didn’t want to wait. Besides, it looked like they were hiding it from everyone.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik breathed annoyedly. “I hope you weren’t seen.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I don’t think so,” said Jo. “I’m sorry, Erik, but I didn’t want Dawn and Donner to be in trouble for this.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik put his hands on Jo’s shoulders. “It’s alright. I’m just … this is a tough time, and I’ve had everyone coming to me for everything.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo clasped her hand gently on Erik’s face. “I’m sorry. I didn’t know. I wish I could help.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Just try to stay out of trouble?” Erik smirked. “Dawn and Donner have been acquitted, by the way,” he added. “Phil testified that the wiring was proper when he saw it the night before. Even Agatha was convinced.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Someone sabotaged the box,” said Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The question is ‘why’.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah,” said Jo. She looked at Erik. Outside, the winds continued to howl. “It looks like the banshee had help.” The cyclone protested the suggestion.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">The phone in Jo’s pocket beeped and vibrated. She pulled it out and looked at the screen. It read: “13” and “4/7”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Oh crap,” she said. “Another roof breech.” She instinctively looked up. “We’re practically underneath it!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’d better go look, then,” said Erik. “We’ll talk about the,” he looked around and lowered his voice, “we’ll talk about the incident later. I’ll be in the office, okay?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Okay!” Jo turned to run off to the breach, then stopped and turned back. “Rich isn’t there, Erik.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I know,” he said. “There’s probably a dozen people there looking for him.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Are you going to tell them what happened?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Not yet. I think … we should probably tell Agatha first. Y’know, people’s representative.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So you’re … doing Rich’s work?” Jo asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik shrugged. “Sort of? Make sure things keep moving until we find a new normal. Someone has to be the mediator, right?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“But you have your own work. You can’t do it all.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What else do we do?” he asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We should…,” Jo caught herself, and remembered her situation. “<em>You</em> should elect someone to replace your role on Council. Then you take over as the lead, I guess?” She chewed her lip for a moment. “I assume you’ve already replaced me?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Actually, no,” said Erik. “We hadn’t gotten to that yet.” He looked at her eyes. “I suppose you could return…”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo shook her head. “No. The tribunal decision needs to stand. We shouldn’t reverse it. It … I … that would suggest that what I did doesn’t matter.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Things have changed,” Erik offered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The present has changed. The past hasn’t,” Jo smiled grimly. “I’m still at fault. You can imagine Agatha’s objection if you bring me back.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik nodded soberly. “Yeah, maybe you’re right. We’d need elect two more to Council,” he mused, quickly adding: “You’ll stay under me.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>They both looked at each other in mild surprise, both faces slowly evolved to display the same sly grin. “Espero que sí,” Jo finally said. “I’ll see you later!” She turned to leave, stopped, then quickly spun to kiss Erik gently on the cheek. Saying nothing more, she took off to the nearest staircase.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Jo hit the stairs, she could hear the unmistakeable sound of a breech in progress above. It meant that it was fresh, it hadn’t been barricaded, and it was going to be nasty. She had to fight against a flood of people trying to get away from the imminent hole, fleeing to the lower levels. She dug into one of her other pants pockets and fished out an old pair of swimming googles. She had them on by the time she got to the top.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The wind was whipping around from up one of the hallways, which led towards the canyon wall, where the ARCH’s roof met the rock. She followed the breeze, until she saw the large crack that had formed. There was no-one else there, nor any equipment prepped to work the problem. <em>One of the population must have called it in.</em> Though her goggles were scratched, she could see that one of the clips that held the roof panel in place had cracked, and part of the roof panel had peeled up. It wasn’t a simple patch: the roof panel would have to be removed and replaced with a new one. And in the gale force wind, it was going to be a tough job.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The floor was starting to accumulate sand at a fast pace, the grains being rammed through the gap at a terrific rate. Jo tried to get close to get a sense of how badly the clips were damaged, but she could feel the sand trying to tear her skin free, the pain eliciting a vision of Henry blown off his feet and disappearing into the sandstorm. She backed off and went to go find the portable wall.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The portable wall was usually kept at the east end of Block 4 on the top level, as the wind patterns tended to cause more damage to the eastern side of the ARCH. The portable wall folded into an eight foot by eight foot by four foot block, mounted on a set of four large wheels. This made moving it around easier, as the wall was also quite heavy. She pushed the block down the hallway, back towards the breech in the roof. The hallways on the uppermost levels had long since had their panelling removed, most of it used for repairs in other areas, or burned for cooking heat during a blackout years earlier. The bare metal studs and struts made it easier for Jo to clip in the portable wall’s anchor, preventing it from moving around while she unfolded it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The wall was erected in stages. First, it was brought across the width of the hallway (and angled in cases where the wall was wider than the hall), which would keep the base in place. Braces were then extended to the floor to keep it from being pushed around. The next level was then lifted up into place, which was locked to the walls, with more braces folded and locked into the first level. This continued until the wall had reached the ceiling. It was never a perfect fit, nor was it meant to be — the wall’s purposes was to protect the supporting team behind the wall, while others were working to seal the hole.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She pulled off her goggles and looked through the plexiglas window. It was easier to see the damage, and it wasn’t good. “Panel, pre-clipped,” she said to herself. Near the walls, the panels were different sizes, owing to the canyon wall’s irregularities. The one that was being slowly torn away looked like it was fairly standard, but it was hard to tell with the deformation. Like all panels, it was numbered: 4-953. “Two people,” she cursed. There was no way to avoid the problem of needing the panel to be held in place while another secured the clips. She reached for her phone, and texted out a reply: “10 4-953 1 2”. The codes were kept simple so people could easily remember them. It wasn’t a hole, it was critical, and she needed a second person.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo ran off for the suits. They were kept next to the portable wall when not in use. There were two, both former motorcycle suits, one slightly larger than Jo, and one quite a bit larger than Jo. One had once been black leather, with a dark red helmet; the larger one was all white. The white had been mostly chipped away, the black scraped clean from the shoulders, arms, and hands, as well as the upper back and front. She gathered the suits and helmets, and raced back to the wall.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next part was the panel. Jo bolted for the workshop, hoping that the page had already been received. With luck, she would only need to grab the prepped panel, return to find someone waiting, and get the new panel in before too much sand had fallen into the gap between the portable wall at the outside edge of the ARCH. In the past, the task of removing the sand had been an annoying burden; now it was a real threat to the ARCH’s safety.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The workshop door was open and work was proceeding inside on … she didn’t bother to look. “Did anyone get my text? I need a roof panel!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah!” one of the guys replied, hauling a piece of metal sheeting that had a hole that would match the piece she needed. “Phil just left with it!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ah, nuts!” Jo cursed, spun, and bolted for the stairwell. <em>How did I not see him? </em>She bounded up the stairs two at a time, accidentally landing on someone’s hand along the way. She threw an apology over her shoulder as she rounded the bend and continued up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phil had already arrived at the portable wall by the time Jo returned. He was suited up in the white suit. The black suit had somehow figured out how to stand on its own. “Hey, Phil!” called Jo loudly as she approached. She made it within a few paces of him before a hand stopped her. The hand was attached to Carl.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They’ve got it,” he said curtly. “You’re not needed.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What?! This is <em>my </em>assignment, Carl!” shouted Jo over the wind. “I already set the rest of this up. You’re the one who doesn’t need to be here!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They’ve got this,” Carl repeated, jabbing his finger into Jo’s shoulder. “You’re not <em>wanted</em>. Is that more clear for you?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What the hell has gotten into you?” Jo demanded. “You run the tunnels, I do maintenance. Why the hell do you need to show up here?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl pressed right up against Jo, partly to be heard but mostly in presence. “We don’t trust you.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’ve made almost every roof repair in the last year! I can patch this, all I need is one more person—“</p>



<p>“So you can kill them?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“To give me a hand keeping the patch in place, ¡cabrón!” she shouted. “The tribunal determined it was an accident!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“And what about Batesworth? Was he an accident, too?” he shouted back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo mouthed an unheard curse. “He died because someone sabotaged the box!”</p>



<p>“You couldn’t stand that he put you on trial, could you?” Carl sneered. He caught Jo’s inbound hand before it struck him. “So predictable. You have a temper, Jo, and its getting people killed.”</p>



<p>“<em>Fuck you, Carl!</em>” she screamed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl produced a heavy wrench in his other hand. “<em>Leave!</em>”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Have it your way, Carl!” said Jo, pulling herself away from his grip. “Try not to let the place collapse, okay?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo walked away, her body at a noticeable tilt from both her momentum and the wind. Carl was turning into a real pig. No, that wasn’t fair to pigs, pigs at least had personality. Carl was more like an obstinate donkey … or a llama. Though with Carl, he spat words.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As she started stomping down the stairs, Erik’s conversation returned. <em>We’d need to elect two more to Council</em>. The Council was already stacked in Carl’s favor, with Erik now the outsider. Jo shuddered at the thought of Carl being in charge, of having any more power than he already seemed to possess. How hard Carl had managed to pass Batesworth’s interview? Batesworth had rejected anyone who didn’t work well with the rest of the team. Carl was a late addition to the class, too, and had never really blended well with the others. He’d resented Erik’s seniority as the TA from the first day and had tried to wrest control of the projects at every turn. Batesworth had kept Carl in check for years. With Batesworth gone and Jo off the Council, Carl was a wild animal let loose from its cage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The lineup outside the Engineer’s Office had no less than twenty people waiting to have their say, get their needs fulfilled, whine about someone they disliked (something Jo was preparing to do), or whatever else it was that people had talked to Bateworth about. Erik sat at his desk, Batesworth’s office left open and vacant. Jo walked over to Batesworth’s chair and sat in it, looking through doorway at Erik. Erik glanced at her and scantly waved. Jo waved back. Then, spying some evil looks from others waiting to talk to Erik, she held up her hands, indicating that she wasn’t trying to skip the line, which of course, she was.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A moment later, the person meeting with Erik — presumably an Engineer — left and Erik stuck his head around the next person. “That was quick,” he remarked. “I think that’s a record, even for you!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I didn’t fix it,” she replied. “Bob and Phil are.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“‘Are’? As in, ‘not fixed yet’?” he asked. “Why aren’t you up there supervising, then?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Carl’s supervising,” she replied. “He told me to go away.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Carl…?” To the protest of the line, Erik walked over to Jo. He looked back. “Sorry, folks, this is important. We’ve got a roof breech. I’ll only be a moment.” Instead of going into Batesworth’s office, he went right for the Council room, Jo followed and closed the door behind them. “What is Carl doing with a roof repair? He should be getting the tunnels ready!” Erik exclaimed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That’s what <em>I </em>said! Then he ordered me to go away.”</p>



<p>Erik looked confused. “You’re the best roof repairer we have. Sending you away is moronic.”</p>



<p>“Stupid is as stupid does…”</p>



<p>“Hey,” cautioned Erik. “Carl might be difficult at times—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Often.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“—but without him in the tunnels, we wouldn’t be as far ahead as we are now.” Jo stared at Erik for several moments. “I know what you’re going to say—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Then don’t make me say it. You’re parroting Batesworth. You don’t believe that the tunnels are in good shape and know the delays are all Carl’s doing, so don’t tell me that things are good. The tunnels are Robert’s baby. We owe <em>him</em>, not Carl.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik sat in one of the chairs and tilted his head back. “I’d kill for an aspirin,” he muttered. “You know I have to try play politics here, right?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Why the hell are we dealing with politics, Erik? We’re supposed to <em>surviving</em>, not negotiating. Playing to Carl’s ego just helps his ego, nothing else.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That’s your opinion,” Erik pointed out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Stop doing Batesworth on me, Erik!” Jo shouted. “You’re <em>not</em> Batesworth. He was objective to a fault. We don’t have time for objective!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Do you think Carl won’t get the roof fixed?” Erik asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That’s not the point, Erik!” she whined.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Actually, it is. Why else did you come here?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo eyed Erik. “It almost feels like I don’t know you. I thought you were on my side, here?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m on everyone’s side, Jo, you know that. I’ve always been the middle guy. You’ve always wanted things your way. You’re usually <em>right</em>, so it’s not that you don’t have your reasons, but you can’t stand there and tell me that you’re the only one who can do it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Well… no,” Jo admitted. “It’s just that…” Jo tried to remember what the point of her argument had been. “It just seems wrong. Why is it all suddenly changing?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I won’t argue with you, there. You might as well be the one leading the tunnels, if he’s going to be fixing the roof,” Erik chuckled. Jo humphed. “Look, I can’t tell Carl not to do what he did. So long as the job’s being done well, the only thing wronged here is your pride.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That doesn’t make me feel any better,” Jo frowned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I know,” said Erik, standing up. “It’s an adjustment period. Once we get settled down in the tunnels, we’ll find a new normal. Until then, let’s just try to keep things calm.” Erik placed his hands on her shoulders again. “Okay?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Okay,” Jo mumbled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Thanks,” Erik smiled. “How are those girders coming along?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“One’s in, Donner and I are trying to get the second one installed,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Thanks, again,” said Erik. “The sooner that’s done, the safer I’ll feel.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">“I need someone to do this job,” Erik had said, “at least until we figure out who’s the new leader.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I still think it should be you, by default. I don’t know why there has be a vote or anything,” Jo had muttered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If the Council doesn’t choose, you know there’ll be resentment, or worse,” Erik had cautioned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I know, I know,” there had been no objection Jo could offer. She had still hated the idea, but she couldn’t fault Erik for his logic. “There has to be someone else to do this, right? Like Bonnie! Bonnie’d be great at this!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Oh, no question,” Erik had agreed, “but who’d replace her? That’s a level of chaos I don’t want to see.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Dawn?” Jo had offered.</p>



<p>“Yes,” Erik had agreed grudgingly, “though the way she and Francis bicker, that’s going to make things harder to do. They make you and Carl look friendly.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“But…,” Jo had tried to think of all the people she knew handling administrative work. There weren’t many, and the others weren’t very good at it. “Why <em>me</em>? I’m supposed to be fixing things. The girders, remember?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’re the only one I trust,” Erik had said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And with that one statement, Jo had come to understand Erik’s true challenge. It was made even clearer when she’d entered the Council room.</p>



<p>“What is <em>she</em> doing here?” Carl demanded. Jo smiled to herself. She had fully expected him to be the first to object. It also gave her a certain amount of pleasure to be a thorn in his side.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’ve been handling Professor Batesworth’s work for the last couple of days, which means my work wasn’t being done,” explained Erik. “And since you so boldly stepped up to deal with roof repair,” Erik cast his version of a disapproving stare, “that left Jo a bit empty-handed. I had her handle my tasks until we can get people permanently reassigned.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That doesn’t give her the right to be here!” Carl protested. “She’s been <em>demoted</em>!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Jo’s here because she has the maintenance status,” Erik said calmly, sitting in his traditional seat. Jo took her old seat. Only Batesworth’s seat remained empty. “Or would you prefer us not have a proper scrum?” Carl offered no reply.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Good,” Erik nodded. “Now, then. Our population is down,” he looked to Batesworth’s chair, “by one. There have been no new births, no additional deaths. Radio signals are static. Jo?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo clasped her hands on her lap, they slid across each other with sweat. “The electrical situation appears to be stable, Dawn’s fixes seem to have done the trick. It appears that…,” she caught a look from Erik that suggested ‘don’t talk about that wire’, “It appears that the station has slid another two millimetres. We need to get those shackles in place very soon, or we’ll miss the window. We’ve got the new moulds into the workshop this morning. Any news when I can get those, Francis?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl and Francis exchanged a quick glance. “Yeah,” said Francis. “We’ll pour them today. Phil’s made the copes and drags for your brackets. The steel’s heating, but it’ll take a few hours to actually melt. With luck, they’ll be ready tomorrow. They won’t be ground or polished—”</p>



<p>Jo waved off any further comment. “Neither were the last ones. So long as they fit, I don’t care if they’re covered in burrs and bark at the moon.” Smiley laughed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Other maintenance issues?” Erik prompted, adding another look that said ‘you know’. Jo’s eyes widened for a second before her memory was jarred. “The work rotations are stable. Kelly’s seeing fewer tunnelling-related injuries, she says ‘thanks’, by the way. Food production is at its normal level, as well.”</p>



<p>“Thanks, Jo,” said Erik. “Smi—“</p>



<p>“The growers are a bit concerned about their new space in the tunnels. They’re wondering if they can get a tour?” Jo looked at Carl. Out of the corner of her eye, she say the glare from Erik that was clearly ‘we didn’t talk about that!’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re still wiring in there,” said Carl, not missing a beat. “It’s a bit dark right now, so they’ll have some trouble seeing. Rich had us focus on getting the residential areas ready first.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo nodded, but said nothing else.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Speaking of which,” said Erik, still glaring at Jo, “what’s the schedule for moving people in? We’ve already had some, but we’ve got a more to go.” He turned to Carl.</p>



<p>Carl and Smiley exchanged a non-verbal moment. “There’s a hundred already moved at the east end of Level 1,” said Smiley. “About a third of Level 1 rooms are ready. They’re a bit dark, though, so it’ll be hard for them at first.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We can move the lights from the ARCH when we move the people,” added Carl. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“And the toilets?” asked Erik.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’ll have one, for now,” said Carl. “We still need a tailings dump. We haven’t finished the dump slots on the upper levels yet.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>One</em> toilet for how many people?” Jo asked incredulously. Another glance from Erik.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“About four hundred,” said Smiley. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’ll need to keep using ARCH’s toilets for a while,” added Carl.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s not ideal,” Erik agreed, “but it’s fine for the short term. If we get the structure stabilized, we should be able to get at least another couple of months before the ARCH’s in serious danger?” Erik looked to Jo, without communicating anything else.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Assuming the girders hold, I think about a month. After that, I’m worried that something’s going to give,” Jo acknowledged.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Alright,” Erik puffed, and placed his hands on the table. “Francis, any updates from you?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Francis shook his head. “Just Jo’s shackles.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Alright, then,” said Erik. “We have a few shoes to fill. The first is Jo’s position on Council.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Why can’t Jo stay?” asked Smiley. “She’s good at what she does.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo turned sharply to her tablemate, unable to hide her joy. “Thank you, Smiley,” she beamed. Smiley tipped a non-existent hat at Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“She’s been stripped of her status,” Carl nearly barked. His frown could have toasted bread.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The tribunal decided that Jo was to be <em>suspended</em> from administrative duties,” Erik corrected, “which means she can be reinstated. Given the current circumstances I’m going to suggest that it’s an option we should consider. That said, we should also consider other <em>appropriate</em> candidates.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Bob,” Carl said quickly. Jo restrained her objection.</p>



<p>“Francis?” asked Erik. Carl’s eyes trained on his neighbor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Bob…,” Francis nodded slightly, “Bob’s got a decent skill. I think he’d be okay.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Bob’s a gofer!” spat Smiley, casting a brutal stare back at Carl. “He has only one opinion, and it ain’t his own.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So Bob’s out,” said Erik.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Hey! That’s two against one!” Carl protested. Erik looked back plainly, but said nothing. “Fine.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Anyone else?” asked Erik. “I would suggest Bonnie, but she said she didn’t want it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What about Phil?” asked Carl. There was an uncomfortable exchange of glances, and no-one said anything else.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Dawn?” suggested Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik looked thoughtful. “Yeah, she’d be a good—“</p>



<p>“NO WAY!” shouted Francis. “You bring her in, and you can forget about getting things from my shop!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Excuse me, <em>Frank</em>,” Erik annunciated clearly for effect. “That workshop and its contents are to support the ARCH. It is <em>not</em> your personal domain.”</p>



<p>“You bring my wife in here, and you’ll need an <em>army</em> to break down those doors,” Francis grumbled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’ll back Francis on that,” said Carl.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik sighed. “Alright, alright. You geniuses have anyone else?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Uncomfortable silence filled the room, and eyes moved from person to person like gnats. Lips were chewed, fingers were tapped.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Okay, in light of no other proposals, we need to consider Smiley’s suggestion. I move to restore Jo to her administrative roles,” said Erik and immediately held up his hand to silence Carl’s imminent outburst. “She’s got the experience and she’s doing the job right now. So unless you’ve got someone else we can all agree on, I think this is the most <em>logical</em> course of action.” He lowered his hand. “Now, objections?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Silence, again. Unlike before, it was a testy silence, the air filled with a electric gloom. Carl sulked in his chair, trying to think of a retort. Francis eyed Carl nervously. Smiley just smiled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In the absence of objections, Jo is restored. I’ll inform Agatha, as I’m sure she won’t like it,” said Erik. Carl pouted fiercely. “Now for the big one,” Erik motioned to Batesworth’s empty seat. “We need a new Council Chair.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Carl!” said Francis quickly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Erik!” said Jo just as quickly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Smiley just smiled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Look, Erik’s had the most experience with dealing with the administration. He’s been working next to Batesworth for years. He already knows the job. This is a no-brainer!” Jo argued.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Erik doesn’t break up fights very well,” said Carl. “He prefers everyone just shut up while he enforces his will.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That doesn’t sound familiar at all,” said Jo flippantly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What did you say?” Carl demanded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You <em>create</em> conflict, Carl!” Jo shot back. “Or are you oblivious to that? At least Erik aims for cooler heads before assessing the problem <em>objectively</em>.”</p>



<p>“You’re his puppet,” Carl sneered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I trust his advice and his decisions. He earned my trust a long time ago. Which is a far cry from anything I have for you,” Jo said quietly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Can I suggest something?” Smiley asked. Carl stopped in his pre-blowout windup and looked at Smiley curiously.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Carl’s a good tunnel manager. He’s dealt with our problems and now we’re able to take people in. But we can’t take everyone. We got a lot left still to do. If you took the top job, Carl, who would take yours? Who would deal with the projects?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“He’s right, Carl,” said Francis, turning to Carl. “Think of the future. We’ll be better off.” Francis added a look that no-one would mistake as ‘you know’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl fought with himself. It almost looked like he would tear himself in two. Finally, he clasped his hands calmly and placed them on the table. “Fine,” he said. “I… I <em>concede</em> the Chair to Erik.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo clapped softly, and was joined by Smiley. Francis clapped a few times awkwardly. Carl merely nodded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik stood. “Thank you.” He moved apprehensively one seat over, and sat gingerly. “I will not take this appointment lightly.” He straightened, and for a moment sat as rigidly as Batesworth ever had. “That now means we need to backfill another spot: my old one.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Jo,” Carl blurted. “Without question. She knows it better than anyone, so you said yourself.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Jo,” agreed Francis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Smiley nodded absently, but also said: “Jo.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik looked at Jo. “Well, that’s a fair bit of support,” he said. “What do you think?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Well, I’d kind of like to finish the work I was doing,” said Jo. She looked nervously at Carl and Francis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Let’s start a transition, then,” said Erik. “Finish up the girder work, get someone else down there to work with you and Donner, and then you’ll move to my old desk.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Okay,” said Jo quietly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“And Jo’s replacement?” asked Carl.</p>



<p>“Well, I’d suggest Dawn, but I since Francis is against it…,” Jo looked at Francis, whose angry nods confirmed his stance, “maybe we can look at…,” Jo cringed at the thought, “Phil?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“He’s not quite as bright as you,” admitted Erik, “but he seems to have a good understanding of things. He’s also good with working with his hands. But that requires him to leave Francis’ team.” Erik looked to Francis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Francis sighed. The thought weighed on him, as did Carl’s demanding countenance. Finally, he nodded. “Yeah, okay. On one condition: I can take Donner. That kid seems pretty smart. Even Dawn talks about him.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo’s face fell. “But he’s really good with fixing things! If we lose him from maintenance—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re starting to move into the tunnels,” said Carl. “And if your repairs hold, we won’t need the maintenance as desperately. We need people to make shielding and wires and tools so we can finish getting people in the tunnels. If Donner’s as good as you say he is, that’ll just make things move faster.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was Jo’s turn to be weighed down with thoughts. It felt like a pebble in her sock, dancing around her toes as she walked. She shook the pebble loose. “Okay,” she admitted. “But only after the girders are in place.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Agreed,” said Erik. “The girders take precedence. Once those are in place, we can shuffle everyone around. Jo, you and I will split the senior coordinator duties until then.” Jo nodded. “Alright, that’s the agenda. Anything else we need to discuss?” Everyone shook their heads. “Let’s get to it.” Everyone stood and headed for the door. “Jo, let’s quickly look over the assignments? You’ve got a while until you can use the shackles, anyway.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik waited until everyone was gone. “Thank you for not going off on Carl today.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It wasn’t easy,” said Jo. She studied his face. “You planned that, didn’t you?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Planned what?” Erik asked innocently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Getting me back on Council,” she said with a smile. “And getting me into your seat.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I need someone I can trust, Jo,” he said. “And frankly, having you around will make this a lot more bearable.” He blushed slightly, looked at the floor and jiggled his hand. “And, yes, I planned that. Getting your vote on Council was important. I knew Carl would put up a fight for the Chair.”</p>



<p>“But he didn’t, really,” said Jo. “That kind of scares me.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Me, too,” said Erik quietly. “He’s eyed Chair for a long time. He had the opportunity and the table was loaded in his favour. How did Smiley talk him down so easily?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They must have talked about something before. Smiley put the gears to him.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik humphed. “Smiley. He’s not the type to do that.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Something’s going on in those tunnels, Erik. More than just digging.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Like what?” asked Erik. “Unless they’re cloning people and making their own army, I don’t know what they could be doing that would be that suspicious.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah, I don’t know, either,” Jo said.</p>



<p>Erik studied Jo. “What aren’t you telling me?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo remained quiet a few moments. “You don’t want to know. Not yet. There’s that term, for when someone can actually say they don’t know?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Plausible deniability.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That. You don’t want to know. Not yet.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Do <em>you</em> know?” asked Erik.</p>



<p>“I … maybe. I’m not sure. I’ve … I have my … thoughts.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’re being strangely unaccusatory,” Erik commented. “Why? What’s going on.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’re now the one in charge, cariño. Someone has to keep an eye on your safety.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You think I’m in danger?”</p>



<p>“We all are.”</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Jo woke up. She had <em>slept</em>, for the second time in as many weeks. She rose from her cramped cot, the springs squeaking and squealing as she rose to sitting, adding short bursts of noise as she pulled on her clothes. She could near snoring in the room beyond. Many had slept, were still sleeping, on a few were awake and whispering nervously. She tiptoed gently through the room and into the hall, attracting a few glances from the awake.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The only sound was slumber. There wasn’t so much as a whiff of wind. It was dead silent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo decided to walk through the atrium, instead of taking the adjacent hallways, to get to the Engineers office. The atmosphere of the atrium should have been easy, taking a break from the bedlam; instead it was strung tight as it strived for silence, mortifed to make a single sound. The periodic cough was stifled. People walked on their toes. Even accidental clanks elicited surprised and terrified looks from those around. Those awake looked up towards the ceiling as if it would suddenly open and drop the universe upon them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Few moved, preferring to stay in their positions. This made getting through the atrium errantly easy. Jo didn’t so much as bump into a single person, where normally she was using her elbow as a spear to force the wall of bodies apart. A few looked up, as if to ask what was wrong, hoping for some semblance of assurance. Jo smiled tersely as she passed them, having nothing else worth offering.</p>



<p>Unlike every previous instance of dead calm that Jo could remember, the Engineer’s Office was devoid of people, except for Erik. He looked as uneasy as Jo felt as she crept through the door.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Where is everyone?” she asked, immediately sensing the loudness of her voice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Good <em>afternoon</em>,” he smirked. “You look rested.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I feel awake, yeah,” she nodded. “You feel as weird about this as I do?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik tapped his fingers on the desk. “Weirder. Every time there’s been a break, people are here looking for something to do outside. You’re the first one to come through the door.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Maybe the last time scared everyone off,” Jo said quietly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Maybe.” Erik didn’t sound convinced. “Maybe they’re all still sleeping. Either way, work still has to be done. I’d send people back out to check that roof panel, if anyone was available. Or maybe out into the valley to find more wood — we used almost all of it at Batesworth’s funeral.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Well, I could go to the roof,” Jo offered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Nuh uh,” Erik shook his head. “Francis told me that your shackles are ready. That’s your priority, we need that done.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Okay,” smiled Jo. “I could use an extra hand or three…?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’ve got Donner. Get Phil to join you, so he gets a feel for handling this on a regular basis. I’ll hold the fort today.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Thanks, Erik,” smiled Jo. She lingered a couple of moments.</p>



<p>Erik lingered at his desk a moment, then got up and walked over to her. “You okay?” he asked gently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s … I think so,” she smiled awkwardly. “So much is … different. Right now, that is. I mean, it’s silent, but we’re not doing what we should be doing when the winds are down, and … it seems okay. Rich is gone, Robert’s gone. You’re in charge. I’m … me, supongo.” She looked up to Erik, who placed a hand on her shoulder, close to her neck. She rested her cheek on Erik’s hand and closed her eyes. “It’s a lot of change. It’s … weird.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Years of doing the same thing every day are hard to break,” he said. He leaned in closer. “Are you okay?” She could feel his breath on her ear and neck.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Sí. Estaré bien, cariño.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Are you ever going to tell me what that means?” he laughed.</p>



<p>Jo twisted her head further and kissed his hand, then stepped towards the door. “Maybe,” she winked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Go on,” he said. “We can talk more later.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo wound her way down to the reservoir to look at the struts. The string showed that nothing had moved. She glanced over to the edge of the wall and saw Donner, still asleep. She poked him with his foot, snapping him from a dream so suddenly that his head hit the wall as he flinched.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“OW!”</p>



<p>“Disculpame, Donner,” said Jo. “Vamos, we need to get started.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Can we eat first?” asked Donner. “I’m starving.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yo también. But we need to get this in before the winds come back,” Jo looked up to the ceiling. “Let’s get the shackles. ¡Vamos!”</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Phil had been waiting for Jo and Donner in the workshop. He was brushing off some of the sharper edges of the still-warm shackles. “I was wondering when you’d show up!” he grinned. “I was about to bring them down myself, but…”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The shackles were heavy, possible for a single person to carry with stops, two could carry much more easily. The pins were less massive, though heavy enough that you didn’t want to drop one on your foot. One by one, the three of them picked up a shackle or a pin, and began to haul the materials down to the reservoir. It took three trips to carry it all, including the rock bolts and fasteners; the rest of the equipment was already waiting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As had been done before, Jo and Phil lifted the heavy shackle up the wall, and Donner slid in the rock bolt to hold it in place so that the other bolts could be slid in. Phil then took the job of turning the bolts in with the long-handled wrench. The first bolt went in with a fair amount of ease, as did the next two, all three going in only tight enough to keep the shackle from falling out under its own weight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fourth bolt, on the top-right corner, got caught barely a third of the way in. “Can’t move it!” said Phil, having cranked the gooseneck quite a way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Back it out, Phil, something’s wrong,” said Jo. “I don’t want to—“ There was loud bang and Phil fell to the ground, the bolt wrench landing on him. All three looked at the bolt and saw only a short length of the shaft coming from the hole. “Mierda.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It snapped!” exclaimed Donner. He looked closely at the end of the bolt, the surface a spiral slope. “What happened?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo took the bolt and showed it to Phil, who took it and scrutinized the metal at the end. “Son of a bitch!” He looked at Jo. “Sorry.” She shrugged off the comment. “This wasn’t properly melted, there’s too much g—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Gold?” said Jo as she looked closer. The metal had dozens of shiny yellowy fragments. “That’s gold, isn’t it?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah,” Phil admitted slowly.</p>



<p>“There’s some in that shackle, too,” said Donner, pointing at the first mount they’d attached to the wall. “What’s gold doing in the steel?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Una buena pregunta, Donner.” Jo looked at Phil. “Why is there gold in the steel, Phil?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phil avoided Jo’s gaze. “We’re … they found gold in one of the tunnels,” he said quickly. “We’ve been smelting it into—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Discs, I know,” said Jo. “You’re making wire, right?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phil looked up. “You <em>know</em>?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I found it in your storage. Lots of it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How did you…?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I was looking for the electrical panel,” said Jo, crouching down to Phil, who was still seated. “I wanted to know what happened to Rich,” she said more quietly. She took a breath before continuing. “While I was looking for it, I found the boxes full of gold discs. You know that it’s easier to draw wire from cylinders, right? That was part of Pranha’s materials course.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phil blinked and stammered a moment, then shook off the questions. “Yeah, I know,” he said. “Look, we’ve been smelting. We tried to get all the previous smelt out, but… obviously, we didn’t.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Can we weld the end of the bolt back on?” asked Donner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phil shook his head. “It won’t be strong enough. Besides, we don’t have anything hot enough we can bring down here.” He looked at the stumped bolt. “We’ve got to back that out.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re going to have to back all of them out,” said Jo.</p>



<p>“This job sucks,” said Donner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Jo and Donner gingerly backed out the three installed bolts, Phil inspected the remaining two bolts for flaws, then went back to the workshop for a replacement and some additional tools to try remove the broken bolt. He returned with a pair of pliers that would have been fitting for pulling thorns from a dragon’s foot. It took the three of them to clamp down on the bolt and wrap the handles with a strong strap. With the mallet, they took turns swinging at the massive plier’s handle to slowly start working the bolt out. The bolt seemed quite comfortable in its home and steadfastly refused eviction. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Suddenly, the pliers slipped free and hit the ground. “Dammit,” said Phil. He looked at the end of the bolt, covered with fresh, shiny scrapes. “We’re going to have to get this on even tighter.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If only a come along would fit,” muttered Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We could improvise one?” suggested Donner. Both Jo and Phil looked at the young man. “Uh, like this!” He picked up the pliers and removed the limp strap, put the pliers back on the bolt and handed the handles to Phil. He then rewrapped the strap, tying a loop, with a bit of slack. He then took an unused rock bolt and slipped it inside the strap loop, and started twisting. The strap tightened quickly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phil looked in amazement. “Huh. That’s really, smart, kid.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“He’s full of this stuff,” smiled Jo. “We’ll twist, you hit, Phil. Just don’t hit us.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The plier’s teeth dug into the bolt, the handles bent slightly under the pull, the strap groaned under the stress. Carefully, Phil malleted at the handles, the shock going up the bolt to Jo and Donner’s hands as they tried to keep the strap tight. Phil hit again and the pliers fell towards the ground again, this time with the head still attached to the bolt. They undid the strap and used the pliers to remove the rest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That end is <em>mangled</em>,” said Phil, looking at the bolt. “I thought you drilled it all out?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I thought we did, too,” said Jo. “There must be a hard rock right at the edge. We can’t move the holes. We’ll have to be careful on this one.”&nbsp;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>The atrium was still uncomfortably quiet, a dreadful anticipation hung over the space like the tranquil eye of a hurricane. People watched the ceiling, the roof, the walls, and each other. They strained for any sign of something about to go wrong, to attack. Which is why they all jumped and yelped when the first pin that secured the girder to the struts that ran up into the atrium started to be hammered into place. The noise was sharp, piercing, and reverberated through the entire structure, splitting off horrid harmonics at every joint. Curiously, after several moments, the atrium’s liveliness picked up, as the silence had been shoved away.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the second girder in place, Jo, Phil, and Donner, rested against the reservoir’s cool concrete wall. They drank heavily from their water bottles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m going to feel this in the morning,” groaned Phil.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Get used to it, Phil, it doesn’t get any easier,” chuckled Jo.</p>



<p>Phil snorted. “You <em>do</em> know I spend most of my day forging and hammering things, right?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m kidding, Phil,” Jo smirked. “Believe me, this is way worse than most of the stuff I’ve had to deal with over the last couple of years.” She gulped another mouthful. “It’s good to have you here.”</p>



<p>They drank again. The only sound was their swallowing. They could scarcely hear the growers talking as they picked food in the greenhouse, many yards away. There was a low mumbling, which was the remnants of conversation from the atrium, having seeped through the levels above.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I hate it when it’s this quiet,” said Jo. “I feel like we need to make noise just to make up for the winds.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Hey, when it’s this quiet, that means no-one’s dying, right?” said Phil.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah,” said Donner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“She’s always angrier afterwards,” said Jo nervously. “It’s always worse.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I just hope we don’t piss her off with all this banging,” said Phil. “D’ya think she can hear us?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Probably,” said Donner. “This has got to be resonating up to the roof.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Oh, it is,” Jo acknowledged.</p>



<p>“At least it’s done,” said Phil. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah, these tools weren’t going to last much longer. Especially the drill and bits. They’ve taken a beating on this job,” said Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How dull is it now?” asked Phil. He looked at the bit, still sitting in the drill. The chisel’s point had been rounded out and looked painfully dull.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We might be able to get one last sharpen out of that,” Phil suggested. “Maybe. There’s not much left.”</p>



<p>Jo moaned softly. “We’re running out of good tools. Running out of parts. Running out of luck.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“C’mon, Jo, we’re not that bad off,” Phil countered lightly. “It’s not easy, but we can make new bits. They just won’t be as good as the old ones, we can’t make high-carbon steel. Look on the bright side, we’ll soon have this place to scrounge for parts! What isn’t useable as a part can be melted down into something new. We’ll have so much we won’t know what to do with it all!” Phil was smiling contentedly. “It won’t be perfect, but it’ll be good. It’s a golden future, Jo. You just need a little more faith.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah, maybe,” said Jo. “I’m probably just letting things get to me. I just can’t help shake this feeling … I dunno, maybe I’m sad about all of this?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“About what?” asked Donner. “Because the Professor died?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No…, well, actually, I guess ‘yes’, but not just that,” Jo rolled the ideas around in her head a moment. “I think I’m sad to leave this,” she said, throwing her arms out to the air. “I mean, we <em>built</em> this place. This place is a love child of Buckminster Fuller and Mary Shelley. It supports <em>thousands</em> of people. Think about that. This place is huge. There’s football stadiums that aren’t this large. This is the sort of thing that ends up in Guinness!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Under what category? ‘Largest Potential Deathtrap’?” Phil chuckled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“‘World’s Largest Fallout Shelter’!” Donner added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You guys don’t feel any attachment to this?” Jo asked. Both of them shook their heads. “Nothing? This place is <em>impressive</em>, when you think about it. Okay, yes, it’s a hodgepodge of designs, but they all work together. And considering almost everything is scavenged and rebuilt from something else, we did a pretty good job with the structure and mechanices. Generations from now, our descendants will talk about it like people talk about Noah’s Ark.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This place?” asked Phil dubiously. “I dunno. Maybe more like … a old hospital that had outlived its usefulness. No-one cries when they’re torn down.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phil’s use of the present tense for things that had become distant history felt like a burning stab. The world didn’t exist beyond their little valley. “Unless you’re the one trying to keep people healthy,” said Jo. “This place <em>feels</em>, you know. Taking care of this place is like taking care of a sick friend. You worry about it, you want them to get healthy. You want to see them come back to life, to run and play.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s a <em>building</em>, Jo. You remember what the Professor says: ‘All buildings fall’,” said Phil.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah,” she said quietly. “Well, this building isn’t falling on my watch,” she grunted, getting back up. “Oh, I almost forgot,” sighed Jo. “Donner, you’re being reassigned to the workshop. You’re going to be working with Francis, now.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I am?” Donner asked sadly. “But… I thought…”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re done. We’re all being reassigned,” said Jo. “Phil’s taking over as head of maintenance.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I am?” asked Phil.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Francis didn’t tell you?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I haven’t seen him,” he said.</p>



<p>“Ah. Well, you’re being promoted. Donner’s taking your old job.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Oh,” Phil and Donner said simultaneously.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo shrugged. “It’s a new world, guys. Get used to change, I guess.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>They picked up the remaining tools, slung whatever they could wherever it would stay, and headed back to the workshop.&nbsp;</p>
