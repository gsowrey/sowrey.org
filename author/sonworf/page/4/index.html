<p class="has-drop-cap">“Where are we going?” Donner asked as they stepped around the occupants of the hallway, most in a half-slumber. Jo kept walking. “Jo? Are you okay?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo stopped. “No.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donner hesitantly touched Jo’s shoulder. “What’s going on?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Robert Ferris was my classmate, a year my senior. He had enough credits to graduate, but he had delayed his own graduation to take Batesworth’s ARCH course. He and Erik were Batesworth’s right hands: Erik was the TA, Robert was … honestly, I think Robert was there to make Batesworth look good.“ Jo tried not to sob. “Robert and I had a lot of chats around the fire in those first few weeks. Random stuff. Movies, food, the places we would build after graduation, places we wanted to visit. He was almost like an older, awesome brother.</p>



<p>“After Block 2 collapsed, Robert was the one who realized that the ARCH was in worse shape than we’d thought. He’s the one who started digging the tunnels. Robert had the plans, knew the schedule, designed the tools. If he were still the one running the project, we’d have moved out of here by now.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So what happened? Why … why are you … why is this happening?” asked Donner. “What’s going on?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No lo sé.” Jo continued walking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donner followed quickly. “Jo?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I … I don’t know,” Jo spat, not turning around. “I don’t know what happened. I don’t know why it happened.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What happened?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo stopped as they entered Block 9. She looked down the hallway towards their destination. She could see others heading in the same direction. “Robert raped and nearly killed a girl.” Whether or not Donner made any sound, Jo didn’t recognize. “That’s what we were told. He’d snapped. Gone crazy. He was in the tunnels, they found him standing over her with her torn clothes and a bloody hammer. They beat him almost to death.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I—,” Donner shuddered. “I’m … sorry.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It wasn’t you,” said Jo quietly. “It wasn’t him,” she added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Huh?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“He didn’t do it. I know he didn’t.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So why—“</p>



<p>“Because,” Jo snapped. “Because. Because we let a friend down. And we’re all going to suffer for it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>They walked down the hallway until they got to the door of an unmarked room at the south-eastern edge of Block 9,&nbsp; one of only a handful of rooms in the ARCH had held no occupants. It was a room not originally conceived in anyone’s plans for the building, one no-one had ever wanted to build, prayed that it was never to be used. But every time the banshee screamed, the room would serve its purpose.</p>



<p>“Go back to the greenhouse,” said Jo, opening the door.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’ll wait,” said Donner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You shouldn’t,” she said, entering the room. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The room was roughly rectangular, with the far wall being a divider between the inner room and an outer space that opened into the outside. Robert stood against the divider, his wrists chained to a loop on the wall that kept him from moving in any direction. His shirt had been wrapped around his head, and gagged him from speaking. On either side of him were two large men with large spears, both pointed towards Robert’s torso. One of the spears had already made a mark, a cut deep enough to cause a trickle of blood to seep down Robert’s side, and to keep Robert from struggling. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo stepped up to Robert. She reached out to untie the shirt from his head and found the spear in her face. “¿Cuál es su problema?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Director’s orders,” said the large man with the pointy stick.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>Director</em>?” Jo asked. “We don’t have a ‘director’.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The guy in charge,” said the other spear-wielder.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The only thing he’s in charge of is the shit between his ears,” Jo muttered, just loudly enough that Robert heard. Jo could see the spasming of a laugh. “I’m sorry, Robbie. I tried to convince them that this was really, <em>really</em> stupid. Even if … even if you had done … <em>something</em>, which I don’t believe, we need you. We need you now more than ever. The Council’s gone to hell. Batesworth is so full of his own delusions that he’s letting Carl do anything he likes.” She let out a short chuckle of derision. “If anyone is a director,” she spoke loudly enough for the two guards to hear clearly, “it’s this guy. It’s a shame you’re too stupid to see it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Whatever, get back!” said the first guard, swinging his spear precariously close to Jo’s head.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m going to see that you spend a lot of time fixing toilets,” she growled as she stepped back against the wall.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Someone’s in a bad mood,” said a pleasant voice in Jo’s ear.</p>



<p>Jo instinctively leaped away and turned to see the voice’s owner. “Dawn!” Jo cursed. “Stop doing that!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dawn giggled. “Sorry, I can’t resist a good scare. You know me!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You pick the worst times for that,” muttered Jo. “What are you doing here?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Francis sent me,” sighed Dawn, “to be his witness.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“He isn’t coming?” Jo balked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No,” grumbled Dawn. “Francis and Carl are working on Batesworth’s orders, so they’re apparently ‘all tied up’.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Of course they are. Consign their friend to his death, don’t have the cojones to see it through.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I don’t want to see this through,” said Dawn. “Robert’s … this can’t be happening.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It shouldn’t be happening. Carl was so quick to damn Robert, he should be here.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Apparently they’re on strict orders.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“From who, Batesworth?” asked Jo.</p>



<p>“You didn’t hear?” asked Dawn. Jo shook her head. “Batesworth appeared in the tunnels a couple of days ago.”</p>



<p>“That, I know,” said Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“He wasn’t happy about the lack of progress.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“He’s not happy about anything right now,” Jo muttered.</p>



<p>“Well, Batesworth marched in about a half hour ago and ordered Carl to start moving people in today!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Today?!” Jo gasped. She looked up at the ceiling. “Dios mío, I think he actually listened for a change!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Carl and Smiley agreed. Then Carl freaked out to Francis.” Dawn leaned in close and whispered. “Francis told me that there’s no way they’ll do it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Wait, you mean they can’t do it, or won’t do it?” &nbsp;</p>



<p>“I don’t know. I don’t know what they’re doing,” Dawn sighed.</p>



<p>“Gah. Some men,” muttered Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Speaking of which,” said Dawn, glancing across the room.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The door had opened and in stepped Professor Batesworth, wearing his Stanford ceremonial robe: black, with red fabric on the sleeves past the elbows and in stripes down the front. He wore his eight-sided black cap. The attire stood out sharply against everyone else’s, as Batesworth had taken great care to keep the regalia in pristine shape. No-one had ever discovered why Batesworth had felt the need to take the regalia out into the middle of the desert.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Such a show off,” whispered Dawn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Batesworth walked to the middle of the room, followed by Erik. Erik looked despondently towards Jo. Batesworth unnecessarily cleared his throat, everyone else in the room already having given him their attention. Batesworth scanned the room, not really meeting with anyone else’s gaze. He produced a slate scrawled with a script — Batesworth never did anything official without a script — and held in front like a town crier. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Robert Ferris, you stand before your peers, convicted by the tribunal for the crimes of sexual assault and battery.” Immediately, Robert started grunting and groaning through the gag. Batesworth ignored the sound and spoke louder. “While these crimes carried harsh punishments in the World That Was, those of us who remain are unable to live with your blight.”</p>



<p>“‘<em>Blight</em>?’” Jo exclaimed. “This is wrong, Professor.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Batesworth ignored Jo and continued. “The Council has conferred and we hereby condemn you to banishment. You will leave the ARCH, never to return. You will live in the wild to the best of your ability. We leave you with a day’s rations, your clothing, and a knife. May God have mercy on your soul.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Robert’s muted screams hit a crescendo, screaming through his shirt, a series of roars and half-gags that would likely have been some kind of denunciation of Batesworth and the Council, and possibly all of humanity, had Robert been able to articulate himself. He was swiftly muted by a whack on the head by one of the spear-holders, Jo whimpered on his behalf. The room fell painfully quiet. There was at worst only a low lone whistle, the banshee apparently having gone to sleep. The outer walls, normally rattling in the winds, offered only a periodic rumble. Batesworth nodded and a door on the divider was opened. The two other guards lowered their poles at Robert, while Erik unhooked the chain that held Robert in place. Robert immediately tried to struggle, until he felt the dagger point under his chin. Surrounded by the pointed poles, he growled a final time, and went through the doorway. A small sack with the rations and the knife clinked in next to him. In a quick motion, Erik removed the chains and the door closed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A heartbeat later, coherent yelling began, along with the mad pounding on the door as Robert tried to break free. “I’m innocent! I didn’t do anything!! This isn’t justice, this is <em>murder!</em>”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Erik,” said Batesworth calmly. Erik nodded painfully and reached for a lever next to the door.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“WAIT!” Jo’s voiced ricocheted around the room. Erik’s hand stopped. “You can’t do this! <em>We</em> can’t do this! Professor Batesworth, this is wrong. What happened was wrong and we can’t change that, but we can change <em>this</em>. We can stop this from becoming even more of a tragedy. Please, for what good is left, we need to stop and rethink this before you regret it!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Your assumption, Ms. De Leon,” Batesworth said barely over his shoulder, “is that there is anything you say is worth hearing.” He looked towards Erik. “Now.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Erik, please, no!” Jo pleaded. Erik looked at Jo, at his hand, at Batesworth, and back to Jo. His hand vibrated in indecision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Now, Erik!” Batesworth demanded. “For the good of the ARCH!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>There was a scraping sound, followed by two shrieks — one in the outer room, one in the inner room — the sound of things sliding and desperate clinging, then only the buffeting of wind. Erik pushed forth on the handle. The buffeting stopped. Erik opened the door again, revealing that the room’s occupant had departed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dawn was holding Jo, who had collapsed to the floor. Jo’s eyes were trained on the empty space, her eyes vacant and wide. “Murderers,” she whispered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;Batesworth tucked his slate away no differently than at a Council meeting, turned, and walked out of the room, the two guards following. Dawn helped Jo to her unsteady feet, holding her for every ounce of support. Erik stood in the corner next to the handle, staring alternately between his feet and Jo. The wind whipped around beyond the walls, lightly rattling the hull plates. Beyond that, there was still a faint yelling, and the sound of rocks hitting the outer door. Jo stared at the door as if it could answer her unspoken question.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Jo,” said Erik softly. He stood next to her, gently placing his hands on her face. “Jo?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s not right,” she said. “None of it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I know. I … it doesn’t make sense to me. Robert wasn’t the sort. He was strong.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“He was stronger than all of us,” said Jo, still staring at the door.</p>



<p>“Was he?” Erik asked. “I mean, we all like to think we’re unstoppable. But we all have our breaking points. Maybe he reached his.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“¡Dáme un respiro!” Jo protested. “You <em>know</em> Robert! Did he ever seem upset to you? Did he even ever have a bad day? Robert was having <em>fun</em> with all of this! It was a challenge, a game to him. And he played it better than anyone.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dawn released her hold of Jo, and Erik took over, holding Jo tight. “Or maybe he just suffered in silence and kept the brave face for the rest of us. He was the guy who smiled at a disaster. He was the one who’d giggle at the terrible hands in poker, knowing he was just going to annoy us with it. He was—“</p>



<p>Jo broke away from Erik. “Stop saying ‘was’! He’s not <em>dead</em>, Erik! He’s still alive! He’s <em>out there! Right! Now!</em>” she stabbed her hand towards the outer wall.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik slumped. “Don’t think I don’t know that, Jo. I pulled the handle. I dumped my friend outside. We decided to let him go.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No, I didn’t decide. The rest of you did,” Jo snarled. She marched towards the door.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Jo! Wait!” Erik called.</p>



<p>“I need to go fix something,” she said as she spun through the doorway.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donner had been waiting patiently outside. He backed against the wall as Jo burst through the door; she didn’t acknowledge him as she roared past in angered silence. He quickly sprang after her as she turned the corner, as eager to stay with her as she was to distance herself from the events she’d witnessed. Donner wisely chose not to say anything to her until they were halfway into the Atrium, and she stopped.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Are you okay?” he asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo wheeled around, ready to tear off something vital. The futility of the instinct caused her to spring right back around.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donner took an unconscious step backward. “I’m sorry.”</p>



<p>Even with her back to him, even over the droning of the Atrium and the wind, Donner heard: “You didn’t do anything.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I can still empathize,” he said. “Even if I don’t understand what happened.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo’s head sagged, her shoulders shook in great hops. Then she suddenly threw out her arms, raised her head, and emitted a sound that the ARCH’s inhabitants usually only heard coming from the outside. It was deep, and powerful, and mournful, and vengeful. The Atrium fell nearly silent except for the sound of a thousand eyes following the screech to its source. The source didn’t care. She walked off solemnly, leaving Donner behind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She wanted to run, wanted to hide. She wanted to disappear. But in the ARCH, there were no places to hide, no places to be alone. There was always someone within an arm’s length of you, a paper thin barrier between your thoughts and someone else’s. And so Jo descended into the greenhouse, where the arms were more involved with creating and sustaining life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve written about my trip to the Soviet Union before. It was, for me, a highly transformational experience. It was the first time I&#8217;d ever travelled outside of North America, it was the furthest I&#8217;d ever been from my family, it was a to a part of the world where I didn&#8217;t speak the language or understand the culture, and I was given freedoms from supervision that &#8230; well, luckily I never got in any real trouble. </p>



<p>By 1989, I&#8217;d flown many times. I&#8217;d flown to Saskatchewan to visit with my mom&#8217;s family, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia on family trips, Florida on a few occasions to visit with my grandmother and her sister and go to Disney World. I had yet to fly over an ocean, nor cross any more than two time zones. (Technically not true, I went three time zones to Victoria, BC when I was a wee babe, but I have zero memory of that and I probably slept the entire time anyway, so I&#8217;m not counting it.) </p>



<p>Going to the Soviet Union put me eight hours over the Atlantic, arriving in Helsinki for a lengthy stopover before going into Moscow. Some 20 hours of transit from the time I entered Pearson International in Malton (identifiable as &#8220;YYZ&#8221; on your luggage tags) before I walked about in Moscow. I had never travelled so far for so long. </p>



<p>Before leaving, I had made the effort to compile some music to listen to. I had my ghettoblaster, my dad&#8217;s record player, and a couple of cords to connect them. All I needed to do was find some songs to put on tape so I&#8217;d have enough listening material to go along. (I also had a new copy of Prince&#8217;s <em>Batman</em> soundtrack, which I played repeatedly, and would trade way while in Leningrad.) </p>



<p>While riffling through a record collection in the basement, skipping past the rather large set of classical albums, I found a near-mint condition copy of <em>December&#8217;s Children (And Everybody&#8217;s)</em> [by] The Rolling Stones. It still had the plastic wrap on the record sleeve, though the plastic had been opened. When asked whose record it was, both of my parents steadfastly denied it was them. I still suspect it was my mom&#8217;s. </p>



<p>Until that point, I had heard <em>(I Can&#8217;t Get No) Satisfaction </em>on the radio countless times (thank you, Top 40 rock stations) and I knew <em>Jumpin&#8217; Jack Flash</em> thanks to CHCH TV&#8217;s <em>Hilarious House of Frightenstein</em>, so I was familiar with The Rolling Stones. The timing of me finding <em>December&#8217;s Children</em> and my impending flight to the Soviet Union is, now, bizarrely fortuitous and weirdly coincidental, because of the first song on Side B: <em>Get Off My Cloud</em>. </p>



<p>Although I didn&#8217;t relate to the majority of the lyrics (that and between the low-quality audio recording&#8217;s distortion combined with Jagger&#8217;s voice, I couldn&#8217;t understand most of it), I locked onto the lines &#8220;Hey, you, get off of my cloud / Don&#8217;t hang around &#8217;cause two&#8217;s a crowd&#8221;. </p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t know it at the time, but I was becoming an introvert, something that wasn&#8217;t really clear to me until years later. Something about telling people &#8220;this is my space, bugger off!&#8221; stuck with me, gave me a kind of confidence. Add to that the fact that there&#8217;s clouds in the sky that I was about to fly through, and the song got regular play on my headphones for years to come. </p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">“Hola, Anita,” said Jo sadly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anita saw Jo’s face and dropped her gardening tools. “¿Que pasó, chica?” She walked quickly to Jo and held her tight. “Es Roberto, ¿no es así?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The great concrete wall around Jo’s heart shattered. Her face contorted, her eyes swelled, her throat tightened. It was all she could do to not wail. Anita held onto her friend, and refused to let go until Jo had finally gasped air.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Estoy bien, estoy bien,” Jo gurgled. She coughed and ahemed a few times. “Estoy bien,” she repeated quietly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No, no lo eres,” said Anita plainly. “Estás herido. Usted está en el dolor.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo took a great, shuddering breath. “Sí.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Lo desterrados, ¿verdad?” asked Anita. Jo nodded slowly. “¡Esos gilipollos! ¿De dónde creen que obtienen el derecho de decidir quién vive y quién muere?” She looked at Jo. “Disculpame. No era mi intención—“</p>



<p>a“Tienes razón,” said Jo. “Soy una gilipolla. Yo no hago oír. No me detuve ellos. Yo no &#8230; Yo no salvarlo.”</p>



<p>“¿Podría usted los ha detenido? ¿Puede usted imaginarse lo que habrían hecho a usted, si hubieras intentado?” Anita asked softly. In the greenhouses, the wind was barely a whisper. “Si intenta salvar a todos, que va a terminar perdiendo a ti mismo.”</p>



<p>Jo sighed. “Odio esta lugar.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Lo odiamos,” Anita smiled curtly and hugged her friend again. “Lo odiamos.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The lights flickered and the greenhouse was plunged into utter blackness. Annoyed murmurs from the various growers in the distance whittled up around the empty space, sounding like unseen skittering creatures. Jo gripped Anita tightly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“¡Jo! Demasiado fuerte!” grunted Anita and pulled an arm free. “¿Dónde está su luz?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>With a shaking hand, Jo reached down into her pants and pulled out a small hand-cranked flashlight. The batteries, well-used, still offered enough charge to light up around her. Jo immediately felt less clingy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Sorry,” Jo muttered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No se preocupe de mí, ir a arreglar las luces,” said Anita.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo walked quickly towards the stairs, before the batteries ran down. “You’ll be okay?” Jo asked, somewhat absently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“¡Es sólo la oscuridad!” laughed Anita as Jo disappeared into the stairwell.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main switch for the greenhouse lights was still engaged. Jo disengaged the switch, primed, and reengaged it. The darkness continued. The lights were on three upwards turns of the spiral staircase, which was moments before the batteries died on her flashlight. She went to the top, went out the door, and down the hallway to a heavy door with a large lock. She produced a set of keys from her pocket, and flicked through for the one marked with a lightning bolt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The breaker room was one of several oft-rebuilt things in the ARCH, having been moved four times from its original position in Block 1, and expanded countless times to manage the electrical input. It was easily the size of a delivery truck’s box and so heavily packed that only small people felt safe moving around inside. The room had metal grates for the floor and ceiling, relying on thermals to circulate air in the small space.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The smell of ozone was thick in the air, along with the unmistakeable scent of burnt wire casing. Jo grabbed a small extinguisher from a bracket on the wall. She had no idea if the thing would even work anymore, or even if she needed it. As no flame presented itself, and the smoke started to clear out, she traced the thinning vapor back to the greenhouse circuit. It looked like someone had taken a flame thrower to part of it, the section melted out, with drips of cooling molten copper on a breaker box beneath it.</p>



<p>Jo reached to a small metal box on her belt and slid out a multitool. It could almost have passed for one of those commercially-available folding models that could turn into pliers, except it was a fair bit wider, and could separate into two major parts. She unfolded a long, thin tool that she had once been told was a fish scaler and hook remover; Jo used it to poke around in things when her fingers wouldn’t fit. She used it to pry loose some of the fused wires and cables, to get a clearer idea of what had happened.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Mierda,” she cursed. She traced up the wiring, looking for the input circuits, no small task in a room built from countless shards of salvaged electrical parts and just as many segments of mismatched wiring, put together by people who hadn’t seen the inside of the <em>American Electricians&#8217; Handbook</em>, let alone had their ticket. The locus of the problem seemed to be nothing more remarkable than a short, albeit one that had fused nearly half a panel and burnt out most of the wiring attached to it. Jo scanned the panel labels and tried to line up the smouldering remains with what the previous crews’ had indicated. Jo grunted and headed out of the room to look for some help.</p>



<p>Jo nearly collided with “DONNER!” as she exited the room. She doubled over and breathed heavily. “Where did you come from?!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I, uh, I was following you.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo looked at him curiously. “Why?”</p>



<p>“In case you needed help?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo smiled as broadly as she could muster with a startled, broken heart. “Thank you, Donner. Thank you.” She reached out and put her hand on his shoulder. “I wish I had a dozen of you right now.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donner looked past Jo into the breaker room. He sniffed the air. “Is it bad?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’ve seen better,” said Jo. “We lost at least a couple feet of wiring, and the greenhouse has gone dark. We’ve got to get those lights back on, fast.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Can I…?” he pointed into the room.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Cuidado, some of that stuff is still live.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donner went into the room and inspected the damage. “Do we have wire?” Donner asked, with a notable excitement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Guess,” smirked Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re stealing again,” Donner concluded. “Who wired this with 10 gauge?! This should be at least 8.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So you know a bit about electrical?” Jo asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“My aunt was an electrician!” he beamed. “She taught me a lot. She’d be really ticked at whoever put this in.”</p>



<p>“Good,” said Jo, hovering at the door. “This repair is on you, then.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Hey Jo!” said Dawn, suddenly appearing at Jo’s side.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“¡Jesús María Madre de Dios en el cielo!” blurted Jo as she careened off the wall of the hallway. Dawn doubled over laughing. “Would you stop doing that!”</p>



<p>“Sorry!” she wheezed trying to catch her breath. “One moment!” She finally got to standing, and between the odd gasp, managed: “I heard the greenhouse had a blackout?”</p>



<p>“Puta,” muttered Jo. “Burnout in the breaker room, by the looks of it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Burnout??” Dawn poked her head through the open door and saw Donner negotiating a perfect distance from any electrical equipment. “Phew! That’s a lot of burned plastic.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s got to be a short,” said Donner from inside the room. “This wiring is… what the hell is this?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ugly isn’t it?” Dawn said. “I installed about half of it, and who knows who changed what since then. The last time I looked in there, it looked like someone had rolled up my granny’s rag quilt.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s worse than that,” said Donner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dawn eyed the young man. “And you get to make comments about my electrical setup, because…?” &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Because he’s a kid, didn’t know who he was speaking to, and frankly,” Jo tried to look apologetic, “he’s right. I dunno who’s been in there, but we’re going to have to tear out and redo most of the lines out to the lower levels. And some of the parts that haven’t melted out.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>Melted?</em>” squawked Dawn. “Why didn’t the breakers trip??”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Someone bypassed them on a few lines,” said Donner. “It looks like they wanted to run more amps than the breakers could handle.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Lemme take a look,” said Dawn suspiciously and got into the room. She went to the panel Donner was inspecting and poked at it. “Ouch!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Careful, it’s still hot,” said Donner. “I think there might still be a live wire in here somewhere.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“See that handle over there, the red one?” Dawn pointed to a large red handle on a box labeled ‘DANGER: DO NOT DISENGAGE’. “Pull the handle down.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Um…,” Donner paused, looking at the sign.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I know,” said Dawn. “Just do it.” She looked at Jo. “We’re going to need your light, Jo.” Jo quickly pulled her portable light out and started cranking on the generator handle. The light spurted to life just as a loud <em>clunk</em> killed the remaining lights in the small room. Moments later, a multitude of cries could be heard. “Donner, the power is now off to this room, you can safely touch anything.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’re sure?” he asked, holding his hand back instinctively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dawn reached past Donner’s hand and put hers right on bare copper. “I’m sure.” She looked at the wiring and snorted. “God, what a mess. I told them not to let anyone in here who didn’t know what they were doing. But noooooo let’s give every Engineer a key because they’re Engineers and they know how to wire a light socket.” Donner snickered. “I’m not kidding. There’s a lot of people who should have the keys taken away.” She stepped back and looked at the mass of melted metal and plastic. “Fuck this.” She started pulling out whatever wires were clearly no longer connected. “Jo, we’re going to need a lot of extra wire. And whatever fuses we can get.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I have no idea where we’re going to find all that,” said Jo. “Not without knocking power out to other places.”</p>



<p>“Francis has a bunch of wire he’s been making for the tunnels. Can you go get a spool?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Francis,” Jo repeated. “You want me to talk to your husband, who doesn’t like me, and tell him to give me something Batesworth said was for the tunnels.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dawn stopped. “Shit. You had to piss him off, didn’t you?” She tapped her foot while she thought. “Screw it, I’ll have to go get it. Phil at least will listen to me. Donner!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“While I’m gone,” Dawn pointed to the tangle of wires she’d pulled out, “get the rest of the junk unhooked so we can get this straightened out. Try to figure out where those high-amp lines are so we can regauge them properly. We’ll need … um … looks like eight, maybe ten bars to jump the lines. A couple dozen connectors. Wire cutters.” As Dawn headed out to the door, she stopped, placed her hands on Jo’s shoulders, and levelled a serious gaze. “Jo, keep the lights on!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Muy divertido.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Dawn headed off down the hall, her hand on the wall just ahead of her, feeling for the next door out; her memory of the ARCH’s hallways were the only thing that would guide her out until lights had been restored.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo cranked away at the hand-powered light while Donner pulled out the burned wiring. “I thought you were forceful,” Donner commented a few moments later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Try being around two dozen know-it-alls all the time who think they know better than you,” Jo replied. She switched hands on the crank. “You don’t survive around here being muy tímida.” She cranked away as Donner ripped out a large chunk. “If you call this surviving.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It could be worse,” said Donner. “Imagine being outside…” He stopped and dropped his head. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Don’t,” Jo nearly snapped. “It wasn’t you. You were… No te preocupes.”</p>



<p>“Can I…?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo finished Donner’s question. “Why did we banish Robert?”</p>



<p>“Sorry,” Donner nodded. “I… I don’t understand.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“He was a … he was found guilty of a crime,” said Jo. “A bad one.”</p>



<p>“Did he … kill someone?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No,” said Jo quietly. “Rape.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Oh.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next question didn’t come and filled the silence. “He was a good man. He … didn’t have to die.” Jo looked at Donner, who looked back, his hands still holding on to wiring. “I don’t know if he did it. I don’t want to believe he did. Robert was one of my friends. He was … he believed in this place. He wanted to do better. Someone like that doesn’t attack someone else. He never even raised his voice.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m s—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Stop saying that you’re sorry!” snapped Jo. “Disculpame. It … there’s just so much wrong right now that I just want to scream.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Okay,” Donner finally said. He turned back to the wiring. “Any chance you’ve got a screwdriver? I need to loosen some of these.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo thankfully stopped cranking the light. “Yeah,” and dug out her multitool. “Slot or Phillips?” She flipped out the slot bit. “It’s probably slot.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How did you ever manage to get this place working?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“On a wing and a prayer.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What’s with the lights?” came Erik’s voice from the door. He immediately saw the increasing pile of toasted wiring. “Oh boy, how bad?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Bad,” both Jo and Donner answered. Jo continued: “Another overload. Dawn went to get some wire so we can fix this.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What circuit blew?” asked Erik.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No se,” said Jo, holding the light for Donner. “But it took out the greenhouse.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Any idea how long until the lights are back on?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>There was a longer pause. “Well?” Jo asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Who, me?” asked Donner. “I’m not—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Remember what I said earlier?” asked Jo. “Let’s assume you’ve got the wiring. How long?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donner uhh’ed for several moments. “A couple of hours?” he said wildly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No offense — it’s ‘Donner’, right? — I’m tripling that estimate,” said Erik.</p>



<p>“I’m guessing a day,” said Jo. She leaned towards Donner and spoke lower: “A-plus for enthusiasm, C-minus for accuracy. This is going to be a <em>lot</em> of work.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik groaned. “I’ll let the Professor know.”</p>



<p>“If you want to be a real hero, cariño, make sure Dawn gets to stay in here. We’ll need her for this.”</p>



<p>“I’ll see what I can do.” Erik disappeared.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What if we can’t fix this?” asked Donner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re Engineers, Donner. We don’t have a choice.”&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Francis’ workshop was on the south side of Block 3, embedded into the canyon wall. It had originally been a shed attached to Block 1 after the ARCH had been moved, but as demand on the workshop increased with the ARCH’s expansion, the location was shifted to something more convenient. Although the move predated the start of tunneling as the ARCH’s replacement, its location proved to be more convenient, being closer to the tunnel’s entrance and exit. As usual, the doors were closed, a precaution Francis had required for safety; most assumed it was because he wanted to keep things from being stolen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dawn pounded on the door several times. A small slit <em>shlicked</em> open and a pair of eyes appeared. “Let me in, Phil,” said Dawn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What’s the password?” Phil asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“For fuck’s sake,” Dawn grumbled. “Let me in or I’ll put your nuts in the forge?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phil started to whine. “You know Francis wants pass—“</p>



<p>“Francis isn’t going to be getting <em>anything</em>,” she shrilled through the slot, “if he doesn’t open this door!” The door unlocked a moment later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Dammit, Francis!” Dawn said loudly as she entered the workshop. It was one of the larger rooms, filled with equipment that allowed fabrication and maintenance of tools and parts that kept the ARCH standing. The room was nearly thirty feet high, the walls were filled with shelves and racks that supported the remaining raw materials, sorted by their composition. A set of workbenches sat in the middle of the room. In one corner, there was a small pile of wood, much of it small sticks scrounged from outside. Longer poles of various lengths, mostly bent, stood in the opposite corner, next to another stand of metal pipes. Sheets of metal scrounged from abandoned stores and warehouses, buildings, including several from vehicles were organized into a rack, next to a huge cabinet of well-used plastic trays, containing nuts and bolts arranged by size and thread count. Against the far wall were a hand-powered grinding wheel, a human-powered bandsaw, and a smelter that needed no less than four people to operate. All were in use, adding to the heat and noise. Everything was covered in layers of red-brown dust from rock and corroded metal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Francis?” Dawn called out. There was no response. “Francis!” She went over to a door towards the back of the workshop. It was, as usual, locked. “Phil!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah?” Phil had returned to his job, assembling shoring for the tunnels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Where’s Francis?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phil shrugged his shoulders. “I dunno, he went off with Carl for something.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dawn shook her head as she walked over to Phil. “And you didn’t think to mention that when I came in?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I thought maybe he came back?” It wasn’t a question so much as ‘please don’t hit me’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You guys made some electrical wire. Where is it?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Storeroom?” Phil shrugged again. Dawn marched back to the door at the back of the shop and started to unlock it. “Hey, uh, Dawn? Francis doesn’t want anyone—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I need wire,” Dawn explained annoyedly. She flung the door open and went in. The room was large, easily twenty feet on a side, filled with makeshift shelving, the shelving filled with boxes, tools, smaller supplies, bolts, and things awaiting use, including rough spools of wiring. Dawn spied one immediately and inspected it. “Hmm. We’ll have to twist that too much.” She spied another one a bit further back, dismissing it immediately as being the same. “Phil! Where’s the heavy wire?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phil, still outside the door, glancing constantly over his shoulder, pointed to another part of the shelving. “Over there,” he said, then adding more quietly: “Next to those boxes.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dawn went to the shelf and tried to pull out a heavy bundle of wire. The boxes that Phil had quietly indicated were enough in the way that she had to try to push them out of the way. Refusing to budge, she called again: “Phil! Gimme a hand!” Phil looked as if he were about to be eaten by a lion. “C’mon!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I, uh, Francis doesn’t want—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Do you like eating, Phil? Are you hungry?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Well, yeah…?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The lights are off in the greenhouse. No lights, no food. I need this wire to get the lights back on, now get your ass in here!” Phil slunk into the room and quickly bolted his way to Dawn. They each took a grip on a wooden box and heaved it off the shelf and onto the floor with a loud clinking. Dawn looked down at the box, the top covered with an old rag. “Honestly, you guys should just melt that crap and get us some more tools,” she muttered, hauling the wire bundle out.</p>



<p>“We, uh, should put this back. Francis doesn’t like things—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I know, I know!” Dawn spat. “I married the twit, <em>remember?</em>” The box back in its place, Dawn heaved up the wire and made for the door. She got about halfway through when she snapped her fingers. “Cutters. Damn. And insulation. Bars. I can’t carry all of this. Phil!” Phil cringed. “Gimme a hand.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I—“</p>



<p>“Now!”&nbsp;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>“Are you sure?” asked Jo as she shone the light as far up the cable run as she could. “There’s nothing else up there?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There’d better not be, or this will be a really short…,” Dawn stopped herself, “I nearly punned that, didn’t I? If we missed something, there’ll be one helluva bang.” She took the crank-light from Jo and looked up again. “Donner, did you see anything else that looked disconnected?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donner was just outside the door, still brushing dust and cobwebs from his hair and clothes. “I don’t know if anything up there was wrong,” he said through a cough, “but I didn’t see any loose wires.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Here’s hoping then,” said Dawn, going over to the master switch. She primed it three times, then took hold of the switch. “Hold onto your butts.” She pulled the arm down to a satisfyingly solid <em>clunk</em>. There was the briefest hint of ozone. Dawn looked around. “Well, that’s a good sign. Jo, flip the first breaker.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo reached out to the breaker, one of a few remaining original ones. She flicked it with a gritty <em>chunk</em>. The light came on in the breaker room. “Also a good sign. Turn on the others?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah,” said Dawn, starting to pick up all the tools and debris. Another <em>chunk</em> was followed moments later by distant cheers. “I think this’ll hold, at least for now.” <em>Chunk.</em> “With any luck, no-one’s hotwired anything into the lines.” <em>Chunk</em>. “Which reminds me, how much of that wire is left?” <em>Click</em>. “Jo?” Dawn turned to see Jo seizing, her hand in a death grip on the metal railing that formed the room’s interior. “JO!” Dawn dove for the master switch and slammed it off. There was a disgruntled <em>bang</em> followed by disgruntled cries as the lights went out again. “JO!” Dawn leaped at Jo, who stumbled and fell to her knees. Dawn grabbed Jo by her shoulders. “Jo! Jo, can you hear me?” Jo’s eyes wandered, neither focusing or locking onto anything. “DONNER!”</p>



<p>Donner was already in the room from the screaming. “What happened?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Get Kelly, quick!” Dawn ordered. Donner was already halfway out of the room and raced down the hallway. “Jo, c’mon, don’t you dare leave me.” Dawn shook Jo lightly. The light on the floor cast ghastly shadows across Jo’s face and onto the ceiling. Dawn reached for Jo’s neck and felt around for a pulse. Her fingers moved between the carotids on either side of Jo’s neck, hoping a new position would find something.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo emitted a tightly withheld whisper that could have passed for someone letting the air out of a rubber balloon by pulling the valve tight, except when heard from across a field. Jo slumped forward onto Dawn, who carefully guided her friend to the floor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No, no, no no no no no!” Dawn tapped Jo on the face, at first lightly, then with more desperate strokes. Jo steadfastly refused to respond. “Jo!!” Dawn felt for breath, held Jo’s wrists, listened to her chest. Everything was silent. She quickly got up on her knees, laid one hand over the other with her heel into Jo’s sternum, and started pumping rapidly, counting under her breath. She then bent down, clamped Jo’s nose shut, propped her mouth open while tilting back her head, and clamping her lips over Jo’s mouth, blew hard twice. Dawn went back to chest compression, repeating her strokes. “You are not dying on me, you bitch!” Jo’s hand spasmed and latched onto Dawn’s arm. Dawn stopped and bent over. “Jo? Jo! Can you hear me??” Jo’s eyes found Dawn and pleaded. “What? Can you breathe?” The faintest of shakes of Jo’s head was all Dawn needed, and rolled Jo on her side and smacked her back with the flat of her hand. Jo coughed, wheezed, and drew in a painful breath on her own. The wheezing continued for several breaths as Dawn rubbed her friends’ back. “Jesus!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Lord… vain…, “gasped Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Whatever, you’re alive.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Called… me… bitch…”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Takes one to know one,” Dawn’s voice shook almost as much as her hands. &nbsp;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>“As usual, you’re wasting my time,” said Kelly, getting to her feet, unplugging the stethoscope from her ears. “You’re fine.” Her shadow bled into the void of the darkened hallway.</p>



<p>“She damn near <em>died</em>, Kelly!” Dawn retorted, kneeling next to Jo.</p>



<p>“And she would have, if it weren’t for you!” said Kelly. She looked to Jo, who was propped against the hallway wall. “I’m going to give this to you as being lucky, by the way. If you were alone, you’d be dead.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Would it feel less painful?” Jo muttered, trying not to rub her sternum. “How long until the tingling goes away?” She flexed her hands and tapped her fingers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How many volts did she get?” Kelly asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Not sure,” said Dawn. “We don’t exactly have standardized electricity. And something definitely went wrong in there. One-ten wouldn’t have jolted Jo that badly.”</p>



<p>“Take it easy for a day,” said Kelly. “And I mean that, Jo. <em>Seriously</em>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Lo se, lo se,” Jo held up her hand to stave off Kelly’s nagging. “I promise, nothing serious.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“And keep thanking her,” Kelly pointed at Dawn as headed into the darkness. She had only gone two steps when the lights snapped back on. “Good, I hate climbing those damned stairs in the dark.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You find it?” Dawn called into the breaker room.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think so,” Donner replied. “It wasn’t easy looking with a lantern.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Just be glad that one still works. Any idea what happened?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think we accidentally wired two lines together.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dawn threw her head back. “Dammit! Junior mistake!” she admonished herself. “Look for any others!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I did. I’m just checking before I throw the rest of the switches.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Be careful!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If I didn’t know any better,” Jo coughed, “I’d say you like him.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I just don’t want to make you run to get Kelly before he dies,” said Dawn. She rolled over and slumped against the wall next to Jo. “I’m really sorry. I can’t believe I made that mistake—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo gripped Dawn’s hand, though not particularly firmly. “No hay problema, hermana. If I had a penny for every mistake I’ve made, we could rebuild the ARCH out of copper.”</p>



<p>“I nearly killed you!” Dawn protested.</p>



<p>“Tell your husband you avenged him for all the times I’ve called him ‘Frank’.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Bitch,” Dawn replied.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Perra.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Slut.”</p>



<p>“Puta.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dawn dug her arm under Jo and pulled her close. “Just promise me one thing: you won’t leave.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Hermana, the banshee herself couldn’t drag me away.” Dawn hugged Jo tightly. “However,” Jo grunted, “you might kill me first if you don’t stop squeezing me so hard.” &nbsp;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>The cheers subsided after a few moments as the last <em>chunk</em> announced the restoration of power. The distant moaning howl resumed its position as the dominant sound. “That should do it,” said Donner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“At least until the next breaker blows,” said Jo. She stood unsteadily. “Let’s hope that’s after we get everyone into tunnels and we have to take all of this apart.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I wish we could change the lock on this door,” said Dawn, shooing Donner from the breaker room and locking the door behind him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Would it matter?” asked Donner. “None of those lines had any rating and I’m pretty sure you’re not supposed to link up so many breakers on a single circuit like that.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dawn looked at Jo. “Is he always such a know-it-all?” she asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Fits right in, doesn’t he?” said Jo with a wink at Donner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If you don’t need me anymore, I’ll go back … to …” Dawn chewed on a lip for a moment and looked back at the breaker room door. “I wonder how many other circuits could use an overhaul?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You know Carl’s going to be hunting for you now that all the lights are on,” said Jo. “You can’t hide from him for long. He’ll just go through your husband.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dawn sighed. “Yeah, I know. Ugh. Back to the blackboards.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Thanks again, Dawn. The help was definitely needed,” said Jo.</p>



<p>“You could have done without the jolt,” said Dawn.</p>



<p>“Well, it’s been too long since I had a cup of coffee. A thousand volts can’t be too far off, right?” Jo smirked. “Besides, I got the rest of the day off, now.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donner looked confused. “Er, does that mean I go back to general labor?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Nope,” smiled Jo. “You get to turn the drill crank.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Oh.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>You might recall the trip to the Soviet Union from <a href="/soundtrack/get-off-my-cloud-by-the-rolling-stones/" class="aioseop-link">my previous soundtrack post. </a>This is related. Because this was the other end of the trip. </p>



<p>Every story has a beginning, a middle, and an end. The middle of my trip to the Soviet Union &#8212; actually <em>being</em> in the Soviet Union &#8212; is an interesting story, to be sure, but it&#8217;s affect on the Soundtrack Of My Life is &#8230; oddly minimal. I listened extensively to Prince&#8217;s <em>Batman</em> album rather extensively, but it didn&#8217;t sink in the same way as the song at the end: <em>Take Me Home</em>. </p>



<p>The trip home to Canada was made for movies: picturesque sidetrack through Helsinki and reverse culture shock as we dug ourselves out from the Soviet experience, a long flight to New York, having to go from JFK to Laguardia during rush hour, running through an airport to make a flight that we were about to miss, only to be delayed on departure and then held up on a very long line to take off. </p>



<p>This is the point in the movie &#8212; just after all that excitement is done and the travellers are on their last leg before home &#8212; when you hear the song that &#8220;ends&#8221; the action. That song was different for everyone (who thought about having a song, anyway), as was made clear when we took a night train from Moscow to Kiev (several demanded Ozzy Osbourne&#8217;s <em>Crazy Train</em>, while I was very much for The Traveling Wilbury&#8217;s <em>End Of The Line</em>). </p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t listen to <em>Take Me Home</em> while on the plane. I didn&#8217;t bring that many tapes with me. But I had it memorized. It played it over and over, looking at my travel companions, building my mental movie scene, panning over everyone, taking the momentary montage of things we&#8217;d done. In the years that would follow, the music to the scene changed, using a live version of <em>Take Me Home</em> from the <em>Serious Hits &#8230; Live!</em> album. Wheels down corresponds with the last &#8220;&#8230;take me home&#8221;. </p>



<p>To be clear: I was happy to be home and sad that it was over. But the ice was also broken &#8212; the <em>need</em> to travel was born and would always be there, haunting me when I became too idle, begging me to see something new and do something different. And with every trip, every adventure, there was the end, coming with the same song: <em>Take Me Home</em>, for I need the people and the places that root me, so I may grow.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Paul Simon released <em>Graceland</em> just as I started high school. Quite a few of my classmates loved the video for <em>You Can Call Me Al</em>, especially the version that featured Chevy Chase. Of the videos, I much preferred <em>Boy In The Bubble</em> because of its side-scrolling animation, reminiscent of both video games and <em>Monty Python</em> (I also preferred the lyrics of <em>Boy In The Bubble</em>).</p>



<p>I remember when Paul Simon guest-starred on <em>Saturday Night Live</em> as the musical guest in the months before <em>Graceland</em> was published. Admittedly, I had to google this, but it was in May 1986, about four months before <em>Graceland </em>was in stores. Paul was on stage, the band behind him, including the members of Ladysmith Black Mambazo, dressed in identical shirts, pants, and shoes. The song started, and Paul stood silent as the band did the accapella introduction to <em>Diamonds On The Soles of her Shoes</em>, complete with motions (I wouldn&#8217;t quite call it a dance as it was supporting the lyrics of the song).</p>



<p>I was baffled by the language. I knew a smattering of French and could recognize several European and Asian languages by the words &#8230; but not Zulu, the language LBM sang. The performance was enthralling, the image of them all singing and quasi-dancing remains very much in my mind over thirty years later. </p>



<p>The success of that night on <em>SNL</em> lead to <em>Diamonds</em> being included on the <em>Graceland</em> album release. Which led to me listening to it repeatedly on my portable cassette player. Which led to my ridicule. </p>



<p>I was on the swim team from Grade 9 to Grade 11. I wasn&#8217;t the strongest swimmer, by a large margin, but I didn&#8217;t do too badly. I got stuck in a lot of long-distance races (such as the dreaded Individual 1600 metre freestyle, which is pretty tiring for the amateur swimmer), so I got used to the music in my head to drown out (no pun intended) the grunting and gasping as I swam. </p>



<p>I joined the swim team kind of &#8220;because&#8221;: because I liked swimming. I wasn&#8217;t an athlete and sports were never particularly interesting to me. I did the junior soccer team one year because my mom thought it was a good idea (and my friend Sonny&#8217;s father&#8217;s company was the sponsor), I practiced to play hockey but gave up before we played a single game because I hated skating (I&#8217;m a terrible Canadian). I loved sailing, which I did for three summers before I started taking jobs. Swimming was just that because my family had a pool and I spent a lot of time in it.</p>



<p>To be fair, I was &#8230; average. I could keep up with the best in the team for about one length of the pool. My cockiness allowed that to happen once. After my ass was thoroughly squashed by the senior guy, I learned my spot in the &#8220;intermediate&#8221; ranks and stayed there, working on my endurance. </p>



<p>Which, honestly, I was okay with. I liked swimming for the sake of swimming, not the competitions. The competitions never thrilled me. In fact, I ended up hating them mostly because of the stupid stress right before I had to up, and the extreme need to pee, regardless of how soon I&#8217;d peed just before. I just wanted to swim. Which probably put me in the wrong perspective with a number of others on the team. </p>



<p>One day, my mother picked me up from school along with a couple of other swimmers, including Chris S., who was a swimmer with the Oakville Aquatic Club and eminently better than myself. (Unlike myself, Chris was a <em>competitor</em>. The OAS had the best in town, including my friend Sonny, and a neighbour of mine, Neil.) Chris was one of the cooler crowd at Oakville Trafalgar High School (in Grade 9, I was the equivalent of pond scum), and as such saw himself as better than me. This was present in class whenever we were near each other, and even in my mom&#8217;s car. </p>



<p>My mom was driving a few swimmers to a special swim meet that allowed us to use the OAS swimmers. I can&#8217;t remember where it was, but mom volunteered to drive us, likely at Queen Elizabeth Park (where my friend Neil attended). As the group of us sat in my mom&#8217;s minivan, we pulled out our respective players and listened to music in relative silence. Chris spied <em>Graceland</em> through the clear plastic window, and promptly made sure I knew his distaste for Paul Simon by mocking the introduction to <em>Diamonds.</em> I don&#8217;t recall anyone else saying anything, either in agreement or defence. And, really, it didn&#8217;t matter.</p>



<p>It was the first time that someone mocked my choice in music, and if you&#8217;ve been reading any of these posts so far, you know there&#8217;s some questionable choices when it comes to popularity. But I didn&#8217;t care. Cool kid or not, <em>I</em> liked <em>Graceland</em>, I loved <em>Diamonds</em>, and that&#8217;s what mattered. I didn&#8217;t care what anyone else thought. It was my first realization of my own tastes and the relevance only to me. It would also be a foundation of how I would later identify my friends more for the music they loved, which also taught me more about new music than anything else I heard&#8230;    </p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Jo pounded on the workshop door, each time cringing from her weakened hands hitting the metal. The slot slid open and a pair of eyes peered out.</p>



<p>“¡Hola!” said Jo. “We need some brackets.”</p>



<p>“Uh huh,” said the eyes, which were attached to Bob. “We’re busy.” And the slit slammed shut.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Batesworth sent us!” Jo shouted at the door.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donner’s face screwed up. “He did? When did he—“ He found his face covered with Jo’s hand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The slit opened again. “Brackets for what?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Girder mounts on the reservoir wall, so we can keep the ARCH from sliding,” said Jo. “Francis didn’t tell you?” The slit closed again. Heavily muted voices discussed something, then the locks on the door disengaged. The door opened and Jo stepped through, waving Donner to follow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The workshop was busy, two people working at the grinder, one turning with the other sharpening pickaxes. One man was walking in the hamster wheel that powered the bandsaw while another was slowly cutting away at a sheet of metal. The room rumbled with the sound of the smelter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Where’s Francis?” asked Jo.</p>



<p>Bob looked like someone has just asked him to translate into Swahili. “I was told to get more shoring!” He threw his hands up and walked over to a stack of premade shoring sections leaning up against the wall. He heaved one up and headed towards the door. “I dunno, ask Phil!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ask Phil what?” asked Phil, appearing like a gopher from the shelving.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Whatcha need?” Phil asked, coming around.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Five flat shackles for mounting girders, eight shackle pins, and eight one-inch concrete bolts,” said Jo. “Preferably steel.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phil whistled. “That’s a lot, Jo. We might have a flat shackle for girders, but if you want concrete bolts, you’re talking a plate on a wall?” Jo nodded. “We’ll have to cast that. I’m not even sure we have enough scrap to melt.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We do,” said Francis, exiting the storeroom. He drew the heavy bolt and locked it into place. “Barely, but I’m pretty sure we’ve got the stock. You got specs?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I can draw them out,” said Jo. “Three of the brackets will need to be dual, and three will be mounted to the support struts.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Oof,” Phil blew. “I think we might have the bolts, we had to make a bunch for Smiley. But those dual brackets will be beasts, that’s going to take a couple of days, at least. Building the negatives will be hard.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I can help with the wax model,” offered Jo. “Anything to get us casting quickly. We don’t have a lot of time.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We can’t get you casting for a few days,” said Francis, shaking his head. “You heard Rich, he wants people moved in those tunnels. We’re turning out the shielding as fast as we can.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“C’mon, Frank, we need those brackets!” Jo protested. “Rich said this was a priority, too. We have to do something before the slip goes too far and the girders won’t fit!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I told you, the smelter’s in use!” he shot back angrily. Jo looked at the smelter, which although hot, looked decidedly unused.</p>



<p>Jo bit her tongue. “How long until we can get <em>something</em>?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A few days,” Francis replied, turning away. “I’ll let you know as soon as we can deal with it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Frank, we don’t have the time!” Jo argued. “The slip is moving nearly two centimeters a week. At that pace, we have only a couple of days—”</p>



<p>“Go away, Jo!” Francis ordered. “We’ll move as quickly as we can, but I can’t do anything for you now!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Now you listen to me!” Jo marched after Francis. “I have a priority need, here!”</p>



<p>Francis wheeled around. “Why is this about you, huh? What about ‘we’? What do you think we’re doing here?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“All I do is ‘we’, Frank!” Jo spat, walking up to her opponent. “I make sure things get fixed so <em>we</em> have a roof over our heads! And I can’t do that if you block the things I need! No brackets, and the struts could give way. How many thousands do you want hurt, Frank?” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Francis shoved her hard, sending her onto the floor just in front of the smelter. “I said <em>leave!</em>” The smelter seemed to roar in agreement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donner raced to help Jo, she waved him off and propped herself up. “What’s up, Frank?” she asked, rubbing the shoulder she’d landed on. “You used to be a part of this team, always helpful. I could rely on you for pretty much any weird thing, no matter how small. Something’s changed. ¿Que esta pasando, amigo?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Nothing. I have work to do,” he said, not turning around. “And my name is <em>Francis</em>!”</p>



<p>“Sure, <em>Frank</em>,” Jo muttered. She flipped up onto her knees to stand, and then spied a small circle of dull yellowy metal on the floor. She picked at it, breaking it loose. It had a bare lustre, though shone when she scratched it with her thumbnail. “What’s this?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What’s what?” Francis asked testily.</p>



<p>“This isn’t aluminum, or steel,” she held it out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Francis looked at the blob in Jo’s hand, and looked a good shade whiter than before, a notable effect since no-one had stood in the sun for years. He snatched the small pebble of metal away. “It’s nothing. Just some brass from brazing solder. Now will you let us get back to work? Take some wax,” he threw his arm towards some dark orange blobs that sat on a shelf, “make your shackle models, and we’ll cast them as soon as possible. I’ll … I’ll make it a priority.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Scout’s honor?” Jo snarked as Francis walked away. She went over to the shelf with the dark orangey wax. She picked up three, and one to Donner. “Grab that patternmaker’s ruler?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The what?” Donner followed Jo’s finger and failed to find her target.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“See that ruler that has two scales?” Donner picked up the indicated tool. “Yeah, that. C’mon, kid, we have some carving to do.” They walked to the door as Phil came in behind them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Seriously, Phil, what’s going on with Francis?” asked Jo.</p>



<p>“Well, y’know,” said Phil.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No, Phil, I don’t know,” Jo replied.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phil looked around and leaned in. “It’s something about how the shares are being given out. I think Carl told Francis they’re keeping more and that’s got a few people real upset.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo blinked absently. “Shares? Shares in what?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phil blinked flounderly. “Y’know, uh, the tunnels — the rooms! — the shares in the spaces, the space we get, y’know, our rooms.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Really?” Jo asked. “Francis hasn’t mentioned that. Or Carl.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Well—“</p>



<p>“Or Professor Batesworth.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phil stammered silently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo nodded. “I’ll make sure to ask them at the next Council meeting. Thanks for the info, Phil.” She and Donner walked out the door, which was quickly closed and latched behind them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What was that about?” Donner asked when they were well beyond hearing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Un buen pregunta. Even with what Dawn said earlier, Frank’s in a weird mood,” said Jo. “And if that was brass, I’m the Queen of Spain.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What was it?” asked Donner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m not sure. I know what a drop of brass brazing looks like, and that wasn’t brass.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So … what do we do?” asked Donner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“About Frank? <em>We </em>are doing nothing. Right now, I need you to start carving out the models for the shackles. You know what they need to look like,” said Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What if I make a mistake?” asked Donner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo cast Donner a sideways glance. “It’s wax,” she said. “We just melt it and carve it again.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Oh, right,” said Donner, feeling a little foolish and a lot relieved. “What are you going to be doing, then?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I need to have a chat with Professor Batesworth. I have a feeling I’m out of the loop on something.”</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Jo knocked on Batesworth’s door frame. “Rich? Got a minute?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Batesworth was hunkered over his desk, looking at something Jo couldn’t see. He opened a drawer, tucked whatever it was away, closed the drawer, then turned to look at Jo.</p>



<p>Jo tucked her hands in front of her. “Reminiscing?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A little,” Batesworth admitted. “Are you here to complain about Carl? Because you can go right back out that door, I don’t want to hear it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo restrained a bristle. “I don’t think so?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Batesworth looked as if he were leaning back in his rigid chair. He folded his arms. “If it’s not Carl, then it’s something collapsing.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re working on bracket moulds for casting now. We should have something mounted soon, that should help keep things in place.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Well, you’ve got your act together,” said Batesworth, adding “for once” just enough under this breath that Jo could hear. “So this is a social call?” There were never social calls in the ARCH.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo breathed through the comment. “I was wondering if you could tell me what my share is? No-one else has told me.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Batesworth’s eyebrows knitted. “Share? You mean like a stock market share?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo shook her head. “I don’t know. I was talking with the guys in the workshop while we were getting our pattern blanks, and they mentioned that Francis and Carl are changing the shares and people were getting upset.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Batesworth’s eyebrows knitted further, a deep groove forming between them. “So this <em>is</em> about Carl…”</p>



<p>“Not … exactly. Not why I’m here, anyway. I just want to know what the shares are about. They said it was about rooms? I didn’t think we were allocating personal spaces like we did before.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Batesworth shook his head. “I swear you kids keep finding ways to confuse me more every day.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m 31, Rich, I’m not a kid anymore.”</p>



<p>“None of you have real-world experience beyond this project—“</p>



<p>“This is not a project anymore, Rich! It hasn’t been for a decade! You keep saying that we haven’t changed, but you’re just as much stuck in the past! We all are! All we’re doing in here is getting older.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Fair point,” Batesworth nodded. “Running around an endless loop certainly does wear on one’s perspective after a while.” They looked at each other a moment before Batesworth’s memory triggered. “Shares.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yes.”</p>



<p>“I have no idea what you’re talking about.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So we’re <em>not</em> reserving spaces for Engineers?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’ve never discussed it in Council, nor has Carl ever mentioned it to me at any time.” Batesworth leaned around Jo. “Erik?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“He’s out.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ask Erik, maybe it’s something that Carl’s brought up with him and it hasn’t come to Council yet.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I doubt that, Erik tends to bring things like this to Council. He doesn’t like it when one of us makes plans without involving the rest,” said Jo. “And it sounds like Carl and Francis have been discussing this quite a bit, it’s got Francis on edge.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’re being nice,” said Batesworth. “You keep calling him ‘Francis’.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You had a point, Professor, I am being una joda.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’ll assume that means you’re apologizing for your comments earlier.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was Jo’s turn to pause. “No. I won’t.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The Council made a decision—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That doesn’t mean the decision was right!”</p>



<p>“It’s not your place to challenge it, Ms. De Leon!” Batesworth commanded. “Judgement was passed by a tribunal. Do you or do you not recognize the validity?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Of the tribunal or the trial?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They are one in the same.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No they aren’t! One is a group of people and one is a process carried out by that group of people!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You can’t have the latter without the former, and there’s no point in having the former if you have no intention of the latter.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Oh, this is pointless!” said Jo. She turned to leave. “¿Por qué vine aquí?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You were asking about ‘shares’, whatever those were.” Batesworth saw the look on Jo’s face. “Something wrong?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You know Spanish? You know what I just said?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Vivo aquí diez años. ¿Crees que no aprendo un poco de español?”</p>



<p>Jo smiled. “Cercano, pero no del todo.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m sorry?” Batesworth asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No, I am, Rich. I didn’t give you credit for trying. Your Spanish might not be fluent, but that’s miles better than just about every other gringo.” She added with a nod: “Gracias.”</p>



<p>“De nada,” smiled Batesworth. “Remind me about the shares tomorrow in the Council meeting. Maybe Carl will be able to shed some light on it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Will do.” Jo again turned to leave.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How are the repairs coming?” Batesworth asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Like I said, me and Donner are carving out the shackles for the walls. Even if we finish quickly, we won’t have them before tomorrow.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Donner?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Remember the kid by the reservoir the other day?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ah, your help,” nodded Batesworth. “Then I won’t keep you. Hopefully you get those shackles quickly and we can stabilize the slide. Which also reminds me…”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Don’t ever call me a ‘hijo de las mil putas’ ever again.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">When Jo woke up in the morning, two thoughts crossed her mind immediately. The first was that she had actually <em>slept</em>, which both thrilled and terrified her. She couldn’t remember the last time she felt even remotely rested. She was sore in a variety of places, which in and of itself wasn’t unusual, though her hands cramped considerably from carving the first wax block. It had been delivered to the workshop for casting, and she and Donner had gone onto the next set of holes for the next shackle. Jo couldn’t even remember coming back to her little bed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second thought sparked almost lock-in-step with the first thought: she’d slept because it was deathly quiet. The lights were out. The wind had stopped.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Everyone had noticed the lack of wind. Constant sounds usually weighed on the human psyche like a thumb over the end of a running garden hose. It was so omnipresent that the sudden lack of the sound left an uneasy feeling, almost everyone exhibiting the kind of nervousness of trench warfare soldiers when the shelling stopped. As she picked her way out of her room and the room beyond, Jo noticed everyone looking up, as if expecting the ceiling to fall in at any moment. No-one talked, the only other sounds were random bare whisper. Ears strained for the slightest sound.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Engineering office was unsurprisingly full. Most of the Engineers and Apprentices had shown, expecting there to be some kind of an announcement, proclamation, marching orders, <em>something</em> to mark the occasion of there being no wind. The room was barely illuminated, battery lights providing limited harsh illumination, casting monstrous shadows across the ceilings and walls. Several people hovering at the door, unable to get inside. Jo could see Erik fielding several streams of questions, Professor Batesworth was engaged in a debate with two rather religious Engineers who were trying to communicate their prophetic fears. The noise in the office was the polar opposite of the outside.</p>



<p>“Hey!” shouted Jo. Only the person next to her took notice, though it was to determine how much louder he had to yell. “¿En serios?”</p>



<p>“Erik!!” she yelled louder, waving her hand-cranked light. Erik was so preoccupied with his assignment board and the fifteen people badgering him that he could barely hear the people next to him, let alone see Jo in the hallway. “We are going to get nothing done like this!” &nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>¡TRANQUILO!</em>” Jo shrieked, immediately silencing the small room. The people nearest to her cringed and instinctively looked up for a moment. “Yes, the wind has stopped. You want orders? Then listen up! I need at least five people to come with me outside to help check for damage and make repairs before the wind comes back.” Jo looked at Erik. “Unless, of course, someone has a better idea?” Erik nodded with the slightest of smirks. “We need at least ten more people to go out scrounging down the hill to see if there’s anything blown off that we can reuse. Anything else is pointless. Any questions?” It took a moment for the room to react, then a few people ducked into the hallway, a few started a quieter conversation, and the rest started to filter back out to their respective assignments. When Jo got into the hallway, she found over twenty people waiting, including Dawn and Donner. Erik stood at the doorway. “Okay, listen up, because I’m only saying this once,” said Jo, feeling for a moment like the stereotypical drill sergeant. She quickly pointed at nine people. “You people are with me. The rest of you head down to Block 9, open the drop in the burial room, use the ladder to get in and out. If it looks remotely useful, bring it back. Waste not, want not. If you even think the wind’s starting to pick up, drop everything and run. ¿Esta bien?” The group nodded and headed off.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the twelve scroungers headed off, Jo turned to the group of eight. “This is the first time in about a year that the winds have stopped. That means we have a very rare window to check for any damage outside. Some of it we know about, and I’m sure there’s a lot we’ve never seen. The goal is to find as many of these problems as we can, fix as many as we can, and at the very least mark where they are so we can fix them later when the wind comes back. Understand that the roof is a dangerous place. We’ve patched probably a third of it. That means there’s hundreds of places you can trip, and probably a few places where you might fall through. If you see a patch covered in sand, take a few moments to check it before you walk on it, and brush sand away to see how deep it is. Deep sand isn’t a concern — it’s been there a while and it’ll continue to be there. Thin sand is because the wind hasn’t blown it away. It might be covering up a potential problem. If it’s less than a knuckle deep, check for cracks or breaks. If it’s more than a knuckle, move on. If you’re not sure, find me and we’ll figure it out together. I will be working at the north side of the canyon, working between Blocks 3 and 6, to move a girder. I’ll have Donner,” Jo waved towards her Apprentice, “with me. If you see him, I won’t be far away. If you don’t see either of us, we’ll probably be in the lower levels moving the girder towards the reservoir wall. Are there any questions?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>One hand went up. “What happens if we do find a problem?” asked an older man, whom Jo assumed was also an Apprentice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You fix it,” said Jo, matter-of-factly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What if we don’t know how?” asked the man.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo groaned. “How many of you have repaired the roof?” Only two hands went up. “Okay… um … Dawn! You find either me or Dawn!” Dawn raised her hand to attract attention. “Any other questions?” The group was silent. “Okay, we’re heading outside <em>now</em>. It’ll be a bit breezy, it’ll likely be dusty. If you have a strip of fabric, wrap it around your mouth and nose to keep the dust out. If you don’t have a strip of fabric, <em>make one.</em>”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Jo…,” said Batesworth from the door.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo turned around. “Yeah?”</p>



<p>“I’m not going to thank you for barging in here and ruining our planning session,” said Batesworth, clearly enough for everyone to hear.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“And how long were you all planning?” Jo asked. “All those who saw a plan, please raise their hands?” Everyone in the hallway looked blankly at anything except Jo or Batesworth. “Nice planning, Rich.”</p>



<p>“You’ve got four hours. After that, we need those people back,” said Batesworth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah!” said Carl, coming from behind Batesworth. “Those are <em>my</em> people! I need them digging!” He spoke louder to the group. “Don’t do anything fancy. If it’s not critical, leave it alone. Get back to the tunnels as soon as you can.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If anyone wants to live long enough for Carl to open the tunnels so we can move, I suggest we start getting outside. This roof is the only thing keeping us alive right now, whether we want to believe it or not.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I need those people—!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They’re not cattle, Carl, they’re <em>Engineers. </em>Go get some general labor,” Jo sneered as she and the volunteers walked away. “I did!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The exit to the roof was at the top of Block 1, a staircase that was built into an outcropping of rock. Not so much a door as an removable roof panel, it took nearly five minutes to unbolt it. Before them, the ARCH’s roof extended away like a slowly rolling field of sand and exposed sheeting. Originally transparent polycarbonate panels, the majority of the ARCH’s roof was metal sheeting of nearly every variety, broken up in sections of increasing randomness as the roof descended towards the distant Block 9. Across the expanse were two dozen large turbines, manufactured from jet engine housings, industrial fans, and alternators, which sat in the winds to generate electricity for the ARCH; they were all motionless. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Stick to the chords whenever possible!” Jo told the group, indicating the straight lines that formed the roof’s tessellation. “That’s where the strength is. Try not to all walk in the same spot at the same time, spread yourself out at least a body length between you. If you have to walk on one of the panels, try to spread your weight out, and be extra careful of it’s patched, some of the patches weren’t put in properly. If you get in to trouble, yell.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The group broke up into three groups of two, each heading in a different direction, leaving Jo, Donner, and Dawn. Jo led the way over to the side of Block 3. The air smelled of dust and was painfully dry. They walked slowly and carefully, their feet testing constantly for strength and traction. It took them nearly fifteen minutes to walk the few hundred feet to where the metal roof cladding met the rock wall.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Well, on the bright side, it’s a tight fit,” Dawn commented. “But we’ll have to remove a panel to get that girder out. I can’t see any other way.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo sighed. “I figured as much. It’s just more time than I thought, and I’m not sure how much time we’ll have.” She looked at the sky, unable to see much to the west past the rim of the canyon. The east sky was a flat beige, without a single fleck of texture or difference in shade. Nothing could offer a hint of the weather’s future. “Dawn, can you go get a rope from Frank’s shop? Donner, I need you to stay here. I’m going inside to loosen the panel.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dawn and Jo headed back inside, moving a bit more quickly, retracting their steps on the dusty roof. Donner leaned against the rock wall for security. Once down the stairs, Dawn headed to the workshop while Jo headed to the north side of Block 3 and the final girder. When she removed the panel, she saw Donner and Dawn wave back. Dawn handed down the rope, which Jo tied through one of the girder’s eyes. The three of them hauled the girder up through the hole, then Jo replaced the panel and headed back outside.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She had only made it up to the edge of Block 1 when the lights started to flicker back to life. Jo stopped and craned every sense she had. Beyond the periodic shuffle-thump of people on the roof, there was no sound of the wind that had grown strong enough to start turning the turbines. “Please, we need more time,” she prayed, and broke into a sprint for the stairs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once again on the roof, Jo took a brief moment to look around, to make sure no-one needed her help. She could only see two of the three roof crews. “Where are the others?” she called out. The members of the other crews looked about, but didn’t offer suggestion. “¡Maldición!” She looked up. The sky was still sandy, hiding any hint of cloud, blue sky, and only the brightest part of the sky hinted at the sun’s location. She squinted, though the light was barely strong enough to cast a faint shadow. There wasn’t time to appreciate what little sunlight she was receiving. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo started back to Donner and Dawn. About halfway along the roof, she caught something on the ridge of the canyon wall. Though a half-mile from where Jo stood, it was clear that it was a woman, perched near the edge of the cliff, her white dress fluttering in the wind. “¿Cómo demonios…?” raised her hand and waved. After a moment, the woman raised her hand and waved slowly, looking as if her arm were caught in the same breeze as her clothing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo cupped her hands. “Hello!” she shouted. “Do you need help?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No, we’re good!” yelled the team over by Block 7. Jo snapped to their direction for a heartbeat, and then back to the woman. The woman was gone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo blinked and rubbed her eyes, then looked again. There was no sign of anyone on the rim, in any direction. “Necesito dormir más.” She walked over to Donner and Dawn. “Dawn, can you go check the teams and make sure they’re alright?” asked Jo. “It sounds like the folks over by 7 are fine, though,” she muttered. “I don’t know where one of the teams went, check over to Block 6?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Will do!” said Dawn, and headed off.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’ll come back up once the girder’s down!” Jo shouted after Dawn. Dawn raised her hand in acknowledgement, but didn’t turn around.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lugging the girder outside posed a different challenge than inside. Though they were able to walk along the chords of the roof, Jo worried silently at the extra weight they exerted on the roof, and kept Donner from moving too quickly. The beams underneath creaked and groaned, twice they had to stop and check the sand depth for safety. They rounded Block 7 carefully, and came over to the top of Block 9, where they slowly let the girder slide over the slope until it was out of sight. When the rope went slack, they let go of the rope.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Okay, it’s down. Let’s get that girder inside!” Jo said, looking up at the sky. The skies to the west seemed a shade darker. “¡Rápido!</p>



<p>“Er, how? Do we slide down?” asked Donner nervously.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Not unless you want to break every bone in your body. That turns into a steep drop-off pretty quickly. We’ll go down inside,” replied Jo, and headed along the back of the dome towards the stairs. She looked back up to the edge of the canyon wall. The woman hadn’t returned.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>From Block 1, Jo and Donner weaved their way all the way down to the dump door in Block 9. The room was filling with torn pieces of roof panels, hunks of metal that likely came out of Block 2, and several piles of sticks with small pieces of sandblasted wood. There was even three curvy sand-frosted glass bottles. Donner and Jo climbed down the ladder to the ground. They could see two groups of two walking back to the ladder, each person with their arms full of treasures to be assessed. They walked along the edge of Block 9 towards their girder. They reached a muddy slick that ran out a few feet before disappearing into the sand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What’s this?” asked Donner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We try to reuse whatever goes down the toilets, sometimes there’s overflow,” said Jo, hopping over it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Phew!” Donner waved his hand past his nose. “And I thought the toilets stank.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The sooner we get back in, the less we have to smell that,” said Jo, and continued to the girder.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The girder lay propped against the dome’s wall, more or less vertical from the ground. For a change, gravity worked in their favor: they got in behind the girder, and with a collective shove pushed it over, hitting the canyon floor with a rattling <em>CLANG!</em>. Several heads appeared like prairie dogs, startled by the sound. Without another word, Jo and Donner each took an end, and Jo led them back to the door in Block 9. Pulling it into the ARCH was another challenge, but it was mostly a straight run into the greenhouse and the reservoir wall. Then it was back to the roof as swiftly as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl waited at the base of the stairs to the roof. “I want my people back,” he said. Jo tried to ignore him as she headed to the stairs. He stepped in front of her. “Now. I’m taking them.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“¿Eres jodidamente estúpido?” Jo tried to shove Carl out of the way, but he clung to the railing. “Carl, they’re <em>fixing the roof</em>. Do you not understand what happens if the roof is not repaired?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They are not your people!” Carl yelled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They’re not <em>yours</em> either, Carl! They’re up there because they <em>volunteered</em> to go up there. Why are you the only one who doesn’t see value in keeping the roof over our heads?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I need those tunnels finished, then we can move on with the plan,” Carl growled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What plan is that?” asked Jo. “Staying alive? Not much of a plan.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’re so small-minded. You don’t see big pictures, never look at the long game. You just worry about your precious roof.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You never understood priorities. This is why you have Dawn to keep you in check, Carl. You couldn’t do it on your own.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl’s face was turning a deep red and Jo could spy his hand moving into a strike. It was interrupted by a shouting from the stairs leading to the roof, Carl and Jo looking up. Something about a rope, and ‘hurry’. Jo shoved the distracted Carl aside and took the stairs two at a time to the roof, Donner in close pursuit. An Apprentice was at the door way. “Who needs a rope?” Donner asked, holding it in his hand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Apprentice, an older man, pointed down towards the edge of Block 5. “Phyllis slipped into a sand trap.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As quickly as possible, the three of them moved down to Block 5. Another Apprentice, presumably the woman named Phyllis, was waist-deep in sand, trying not to move and failing at not panicking. Another Engineer, Jake, was perched at the edge. Donner handed Jake the rope, the end of which was carefully tossed to Phyllis. The four of them slowly dragged Phyllis from the sand trap and onto the roof.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How deep was it?” asked Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I didn’t touch bottom,” said Phyllis. She looked at Jake. “I… I slipped.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jake looked at Jo. “There’s a few of these along this side,” he pointed to another visible one where Blocks 5 and 8 overlapped with Block 4. “Some of these are really deep.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ugh,” Jo groaned. “That’s a lot of weight.”</p>



<p>“That might explain some of the shift,” offered Donner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo nodded. “We should have flattened that part out when we had the chance. If the winds don’t pick up again tomorrow, maybe we’ll get a few people out there to get the sand off. That might buy us a few more days.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If the winds stay quiet,” said Jake, looking at the blank beige sky. The last time, we got a few days. I can’t even remember the time before that.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>A voice called from back at the stairs. Jo turned to see Erik waving both of his hands. “¿Qué?” she yelled. “I can’t hear you!!” Erik yelled something again, but still went unheard. Jo looked at Donner. “You help them, okay? I’ll see what Erik wants.” She worked her way the length of a football field back to the doorway.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Your time is up,” said Erik as Jo approached. “Carl wants his people back.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah, he blocked me at the stairs. You know he nearly hit me?”</p>



<p>“He’s already taken the people from the canyon floor,” said Erik.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“¡¿Qué?!” Jo blurted. “They were finding materials! They had at least a hundred pounds of stuff we can smelt into—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I know,” said Erik calmly. “He took it all to Francis’s shop. He wants Dawn back, in particular.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What about the repairs, Erik? How the hell are we supposed to keep the roof up if we can’t actually <em>fix</em> it?!” Jo demanded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik held out both his hands to hold back Jo’s anger. “Relax, I’m on your side!” he said. “I’ll stall him as long as I can. I just don’t know how long that’ll be.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Gracias, Cariño. Maybe I can figure out how to bolt the door from this side,” Jo smiled slyly. She turned and started to head back to Dawn’s group as Erik headed down the stairs. She looked up at the canyon rim again. The woman was back. Jo stopped in her tracks and looked hard. At the distance, it was impossible to make out any details. Jo waved her hands above her head. The woman waved her hand as she had before, then pointed to the west. Jo followed the woman’s pointing, and saw a terribly dark, boiling cloud barreling towards them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo turned and shrieked: “EVERYONE INSIDE! <em>NOW!!!</em>”</p>



<p>Dawn’s team looked towards Jo, saw the cloud, and bolted. They sprinted across the chords and panels as if they were the sturdiest concrete. The other team, well away at the edge of Block 5, hadn’t so much as flinched. The turbines were moving faster, the blades blurring into translucent discs.</p>



<p>“INSIDE!! GET INSIDE!! STORM APPROACHING!!” Jo felt her vocal chords starting to blow out. The dusty wind held the odd speck of sand, which flicked off bare skin, a warning of things to come. One of the team looked up, hearing the echoes of Jo’s voice. Even at a distance, the dawning look of horror was clear, and the two scrambled up the edges and raced across the roof. The latecomers ducked low, fighting against the increasing force. Jo had backed towards the doorway,&nbsp; door’s inner handle. Dawn’s team reached the door first, all quickly passed inside, with Donner staying just beyond the entrance. Jo clung to the outside, beckoning the remaining two Engineers to hurry. A low hum began to vibrate through the roof, a harmonic from the wind over the surface. Not far away, a shrill overtone began to climb.</p>



<p>Jo looked back to Donner. “Where’s the rope?” she asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donner looked around. “Who has the rope?” He shouted down the stairs, then disappeared after the unheard response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“¡VAMOS! HURRY!” Jo shouted towards the two approaching people. They had only gotten as far as the edge of Block 3, and looked to be at a near standstill. The wind wasn’t strong enough to stop them, but the sand in the wind blinded them entirely. Not able to see where they were going, they slunk lower to the roof, walking in a line into the wind, their in front of their eyes, the front person feeling with his feet to ensure they were on the supports instead of the panels. “MOVE!” Jo screamed. One waved their hand desperately. “Where’s that rope?!” Jo called down the stairs. Suddenly the front person fell forward. The second let go of the first’s hands, springing to standing. “GET DOWN!” screamed Jo. “GET DOWN!!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>A gust of wind was all it took. The second person was blown over rolling onto their back. The wind rolled him down the curve of Block 4, across the plateau between Blocks 4, 5, and 6, and rolled around behind the edge of Block 8.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Got it!” Donner shouted over the wind, handing Jo the end of the rope they had used earlier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Tie it off!!” she shouted back. Donner quickly bound the end to the metal stair railing, as Jo lashed it around her waist. She was only a few steps beyond the door when her feet were swept out from under her, carrying her across the rooftop like the other man. She bounced several times before she finally landed, face down, on a panel and stopped. Her head rang with a hundred bells from the impacts. She squinted against the sand in the wind to spy the person who’d gone prone against the roof. He was barely ten feet away. Slowly, Jo turned herself around, and pulled herself across the surface until she was next to him. She linked her arm into his, and then tugged on the rope. She felt it start to pull, and she started to pull on it, and the man. The two of them inched their way towards the door, the sand tearing at their exposed skin. They kept their eyes closed, their eyelids being scratched. Getting back to the doorway, Dawn pulled the man inside as Donner pulled in Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’ve got to go for Henry!” the man moaned over the increasing wind. “He’s still out there!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo wiped away bloody tears from her eyes and looked out the doorway. The sand was so thick that they could barely see a dozen feet beyond. The top of Block 4 was gone, and anything beyond was no more than a memory. Jo sat heavily. “Someone get the suit!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Is Henry in the same place?” asked Dawn.</p>



<p>“No,” Jo choked. “He got blown over. He’s … somewhere. Hopefully on Block 8!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Block 8?! Forget it, Jo! Even if the suit protected you enough for this, an unprotected person wouldn’t survive! Besides, this rope isn’t long enough. I don’t think we have enough rope for you to go that far!” Dawn said, barely audible in the stairway. “He’s lost.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No!” the man shouted, grabbing Jo by her bloodied shirt. “We can’t leave him out there! He’ll <em>die!</em>”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“He’s dead already,” said Dawn, pulling the man off of Jo. “And if it wasn’t for Jo, you’d be dead, too.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’ve killed him,” the man said, collapsing. “You sent us out there to die.” He looked at Jo. “Y’know, we only hear the banshee when someone’s going to die.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Get to the infirmary!” Dawn pushed the man towards the stairs. Jo continued to look out the door, feeling the sand starting to fall on her hair and in her eyes. Donner and Dawn pulled the door shut and started to bolt it closed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Are you okay?” Dawn asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No,” Jo said quietly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It wasn’t your fault, Jo,” said Dawn. “We all know that the weather can change without warning. We thought we’d have time.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Who’s the ‘Banshee’?” Donner asked almost quietly enough not to be heard.</p>



<p>Jo looked at him, wiping tears from her eyes. She moved to speak, then retreated. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Banshees are Irish ghosts,” said Dawn. “They wail when someone is about to die.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo spoke up before Donner could ask another question. “My Mother’s side was Latino, mostly Mexican. My Dad’s side was Irish.” She wiped another tear, cringing slightly from the sting of open cuts. “When the winds started to cause vibrations and echoes in the ARCH, we were only worried about things coming lose. One day, it shrieked like nothing we’d ever heard before, and I joked that it sounded like the banshee stories my grandmother used to tell me.” Jo sighed and sobbed.</p>



<p>“The next day, we found out that someone had died. The name stuck,” said Dawn. “Every time the banshee screams, someone dies.”&nbsp;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			
<p>In Grade 11, I got a job, one I got myself instead of having it given to me. The two years before, I had been a general labourer at the company my father worked for, a shop boy who swept up after the guys who built diesel generators, helped build a contained office for my boss, Richard, moved things around with a forklift, and generally got dirty as hell. It paid decent, but I worked my father&#8217;s longer hours, as he was my ride to and from work.</p>



<p>In Grade 11, my mother showed me that Black&#8217;s Camera was hiring. Black&#8217;s barely exists anymore, reduced to little more than a website doing photo reproduction work. In 1988, it was still one of the major chains that worked with film (interestingly, 1988 was also the year the first-ever digital SLR was released, though I wouldn&#8217;t know of that for over another decade), so the hour-print service in the store was usually busy. </p>



<p>I had gotten the job because I knew a bit about cameras and film and how they worked together to make pictures; ASA/ISOs, primarily. My father had given me my first SLR &#8212; a Minolta X370 &#8212; just prior to my SEVEC adventure a few years earlier, and I had used it as much as I could afford to (well, as must as my parents were willing to pay for my pictures, anyway &#8212; this was one reason my mother pressed me to get the job at Black&#8217;s).</p>



<p>Our store was perhaps one of the dumpier ones. It was in Trafalgar Village, a perpetual &#8220;death mall&#8221; where stores typically didn&#8217;t last. I never really understood why &#8212; the mall was wedged between the GO station and the QEW, had good road access, and a big parking lot. But everyone avoided it. It was an I-shaped mall, with the ends being the anchors: Food City (the grocery store) on one end, Woolco on the other. The Black&#8217;s was wedged right next to the Woolco entrance inside the mall, so we had a fair bit of foot traffic. </p>



<p>The anchor stores would change over time. Woolco closed down and was bought out by Walmart as it set foot in Canada. The Food City would eventually become a No Frills, a literal no-name brand food store where everything is labeled yellow with only words, as basic as it gets. The Walmart would eventually moved and be replaced by a Home Depot. After the Walmart moved, Trafalgar Village was mostly razed, the centre section of the I demolished, leaving the anchor buildings &#8230; and the Golden Griddle, a waffle house, which only recently closed.  </p>



<p>I worked with a small group: three developers, two (other) sales people, the assistant manager, and the manager, Sue. I got along particularly well with Mark (one of the sales people) and Jessica (one of the developers), both of whom went to Sheridan College, and both of whom loved <em>Monty Python</em>. It was from them I got my initial education in all things British Absurdist, even to the point where I had watched <em>Monty Python and The Holy Grail</em> before going to the University of Waterloo, where <em>The Holy Grail</em> is the unofficial movie mascot. </p>



<p>I was the kid. The young one. I did the bulk of the intake for film, both the hourly service and the special orders. Despite Sue&#8217;s encouragement, I didn&#8217;t feel comfortable doing sales, partly because I was in an introverted period of my life, but also because Mark and the other sales staff were so much better at it. Mark did teach me a number of things, but I only ever once sold a camera during the Christmas rush. </p>



<p>Every day that I worked, I would trudged over after school. Oakville Trafalgar High School was a kilometre and a half from Black&#8217;s, a quick bike ride or a walk (in the only winter I worked there). On the days that I walked, I brought my portable cassette player, which regularly featured The Rolling Stones&#8217; <em>Hot Rocks</em> album, a two-cassette compilation (my first and only double-cassette album) that stayed almost permanently in that player. </p>



<p>Aside from <em>Get Off My Cloud</em>, it had many of the Stones&#8217; other classics, such as <em>(I Can&#8217;t Get No) Satisfaction</em>, <em>Brown Sugar</em>, <em>Gimme Shelter</em>, <em>Paint It Black</em>, and <em>Sympathy For The Devil</em>. I distinctly remember walking across a cold, snow-filled parking lot to the southwest entrance of Trafalgar Village one dark evening, Mick and crew blaring in my headphones. I played all four sides constantly, but found side three (Side A of Tape 2), which started off with <em>Jumpin&#8217; Jack Flash</em>, a frequently-played side, often rewound and restarted. And there&#8217;s a reason. </p>



<p>In Hamilton, two cities to the west of Oakville, at the northwestern end of Lake Ontario, there is a television station that went by the call letters CHCH. In my youth, it was one of the few TV stations that didn&#8217;t have affiliations with CBC, CTV, Global, or CHUM, which were the major communications companies at the time. This allowed them to do pretty much whatever the hell they wanted, and what they did was produce <em>The Hilarious House Of Frightenstein</em>, a classic horror-esque kids show about an incompetent scientist unable to bring his Frankenstein-like monster (&#8220;Brucie&#8221;) to life, and the people who lived in his castle.</p>



<p>Of note in this menagerie of people (most of whom were all played by the same actor, Billy Van), the Wolfman stood out the most to me (other than Vincent Price &#8212; yes, <em>that</em> Vincent Price &#8212; because &#8230; well, <em>Vincent Price</em>). The Wolfman (modelled after &#8220;Wolfman Jack&#8221;, the real US DJ) was the host of the radio station, whose segment always opened with a brief cut of Sly and the Family Stone&#8217;s <em>I Want To Take You Higher</em>. He would talk a bit, then he would play his song of the day, which usually involved him and Igor (another character in the show) walking into a psychedelic background (filmed on a blue screen; the &#8220;I&#8221; on Igor&#8217;s shirt would go transparent and always show the background) and danced to the song. One frequent play of theirs was <em>Jumpin&#8217; Jack Flash</em>. </p>



<p>I worked at Black&#8217;s until late fall of 1988. I had started a Co-operative Education stream at high school, which strived to put students into &#8220;real&#8221; jobs to get them an initial kick at life. (I would do this again in university, which paid for my education.) I was placed in a computer store downtown, for which I had the world&#8217;s shortest interview (I begged for longer one, just because I needed the credit). Although an unpaid position, I spent so much time there helping out that I ran my required 200 hours in short term, and Rob (the boss) hired me outright. I was relieved as the Black&#8217;s job no longer had the appeal, as Sue had returned to the Jackson Square location in Hamilton and her replacement was trying to make a name for himself in all the worst ways. I quit over the phone and never worked a shift there ever again. </p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">“Professor, we have a problem!” Carl announced, trotting into his office.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Batesworth looked away from the schematics on his walls. “What is now, Carl?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Jo’s killed an Engineer!”</p>



<p>Batesworth slumped slightly. “What? How?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“She took a bunch of people on the roof—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I know, she was down here a few hours ago looking for volunteers. You took back the ones on the canyon floor not too long ago. The rest were on the roof making repairs.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The wind came up,” Carl said. The corner of his mouth curled. “She threw one of them to his death.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“‘Threw’?” Batesworth’s eyebrow crested like a wave. “Jo’s not one to throw people, even at her worst.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“She left him to die.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That’s different than ‘throw’, Carl,” said Batesworth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’re missing the point, Professor!” Carl pressed. “Someone’s dead and it’s Jo’s fault!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I understand your concern, Carl, but I need more details. What <em>exactly</em> happened?” Batesworth stood and scanned Carl’s face.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The group was on the roof, the wind picked up, and Jo left one behind. <em>Intentionally</em>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“She knowingly left someone out there in the windstorm?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yes.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“And you were there to witness this, yourself, with your own eyes?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl hesitated. “No, I was back in the tunnels when—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“And you know what happened, how?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Dawn told me,” said Carl. “She was there. She saw the whole thing. She can vouch for everything I’ve just told you!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Anyone else see this?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl chewed a moment. “There’s that guy that’s been hanging around with her, her assistant,” he said grudgingly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Batesworth nodded. “Do you know the name of the deceased?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I thought you knew the names of all the Engineers, Carl.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“He was … an Apprentice, I think.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That’s an important detail, hmm?” Batesworth returned to his chair. “Jo led a team to the roof, which included her assistant, Dawn, and some Apprentices. The wind picked up, and Jo <em>intentionally</em> left someone outside. That’s your statement?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl nodded. “Yes. Intentionally killed someone.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How is it that you’re always the one to come in here and tell me that the Engineers are committing horrible acts, Carl?” Batesworth took a deep breath and let it slowly back out. “Where is Jo now?”</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>The lowest point of the ARCH was on the downward slope of the canyon floor, a crawlspace under Block 9’s bottom floor as it spanned over boulders. The outside wind caused just enough of a draft through the multitude of gaps to keep the dark void dusty. A lone figure lay in a well-used patch, curled up in the dimness, her back turned against the small world behind. The wind was little more than a low moaning, the high-velocity winds affecting only the older, upper options of the structure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite all efforts to the contrary, the figure would not be left alone long.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Jo,” called a voice near the void’s mouth. “Come out. Talk to me.” With an apparent lack of response or motion, Erik sat down on the ground and peered in. “I know you’re in there. As much as you think you can hide away, you can’t. I know your places, even this one.” He waited a few moments for any kind of acknowledgement. “I can’t say I know what you’re going through. I don’t. I’ve not done what you’ve done — wait, sorry, that wasn’t… I don’t know how to do what you do, how you see things and their effects. You saw the problems before anyone else, you’re the only one who spoke up about them. You saw the value of the wind having died down before any of us were … were willing to do anything about it.” Erik looked for movement. “Going outside is risky, too many of us are terrified of what could happen that we never think about alternative.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Carl did,” said Jo, her response muted and echoey. “He thinks I’m too stupid to think of the risks.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah, he mentioned something like that to me,” Erik nodded. “You know what I told him?” Erik waited for a response that didn’t come. “I told him that you’re the only one brave enough to go outside. The only one smart enough to know the risks of going outside. People followed you because they trust you, Jo. They know what you’re capable of. It doesn’t matter what Carl thinks or says. He’s so afraid of you that his mouth speaks before his brain thinks and he just looks worse every time. You did what needed to be done, the only one courageous enough to open the door and step outside.” He stopped looking into the void, brought his knees to his chin and stared off across the space. “People trust you, follow you. That’s way more than … well, pretty much more than the rest of us can say. People listen to us, but they don’t believe us, not me or Rich or Carl or Bonnie or Francis. When you speak, they believe you.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo appeared at Erik’s side. “Do you believe me?”</p>



<p>Erik smiled. “Always.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Slowly, Jo reached out and touched Erik on the shoulder. “Gracias, cariño.Yo necesitaba eso.” She sidled up next to him like cat. “Te necesito.” Hesitantly, Erik moved his arm around her. She pulled his arm all the way around her, encouraging a tight hold. “Te amo,” she whispered.&nbsp;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>“Have a seat,” said Batesworth, tapping a chair he had brought into his cramped office. Jo, her arms wrapped around herself tightly, looked at Batesworth, then the chair. She looked back towards Erik, who stood out of Batesworth’s view. “I just want to talk, Jo. We have to talk.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo tentatively stepped into the room and slowly sat on the front part of the seat, her arms still in place. She looked at a random diagram on the wall, not registering anything else about it. “I killed someone,” she said softly. “I killed Henry.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Batesworth leaned forward, resting his elbows on his chair. “I’ve heard. I don’t suppose you want to talk about what happened?” Jo fiercely shook her head. “We can’t ignore this, Jo. It’s happened. As much as you might want to forget it, you can’t change what was done.” He leaned back to sit upright. “I won’t ask if you think you’re responsible. You take responsibility far more seriously than most.” He looked at Jo’s unmoving expression, her eyes locked on a point many yards past the picture on the wall. “This isn’t something we can’t sweep away, even if it was one of us. You know that, right?” Jo nodded slightly. “We will have to convene a tribunal.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo stiffened. “I … they … if I’m convicted … you’ll banish me.” Tears erupted and rolled down her cheek.</p>



<p>Batesworth watch the drops seep down her skin, falling loose from her chin, onto the floor with a light <em>pit</em> sound, forming a tiny mud puddle from the dust. “It’s a possibility,” he nodded. “If you are convicted, the Council has the right to pass judgement, which includes the potential for banishment. But I don’t think the Council will—“</p>



<p>“Carl hates me,” said Jo. “He banished Robert. He hated Robert, too. Frank will say what Carl says.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Carl is opinionated, no less than you. You fought for Robert’s clemency, as I recall, very vehemently.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo faced Batesworth. “I’m on trial, Rich. I don’t get a say.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Batesworth leaned forward again, nodding. “True. That is true. In fact, we’ll probably have a stalemate. We’ll have to include another person for quorum.”</p>



<p>“Dawn,” said Jo.</p>



<p>“Perhaps,” said Batesworth. “Francis might have a few words to say about that.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When?” said Jo.</p>



<p>“Francis? Well, I haven’t talked to him yet—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The trial.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Oh. Not at least for a day or two. We’ll have to prepare, talk to witnesses, you know the process. I have to find Agatha and make sure she’s still willing to participate.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Jail.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Jail?” Batesworth asked. “You?” He shook his head. “Jail … locking you up in a room doesn’t help anyone right now. You’re not on a murderous spree, you do not pose a risk.” He scratched at his chin. “If anything, I would say putting you <em>in</em> jail is a risk to all of us. As I recall, you’re working on that reinforcement in the greenhouse.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo nodded slowly.</p>



<p>“How much work is left?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I … I’m not sure,” said Jo. “We … um, we have mould blocks. We, uh, have to carve them… then the workshop can cast. If that goes well, maybe … three days? I think?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Erik!” Batesworth called. Erik appeared at the doorway. “We will be conducting a tribunal to investigate the death of Apprentice Henry … last name?” Batesworth looked at both Erik and Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Sorry, I didn’t even know his first name,” Erik said. Jo shook her head.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We will ensure to get that detail,” said Batesworth. “In the meantime, Ms. De Leon is on suspension until the tribunal. If anyone asks, she is being isolated from the population.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“And in reality?” Erik asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Saving the ARCH.”&nbsp;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>“I’m going to die,” shuddered Jo. “Carl will make sure of it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Carl can stuff it,” said Erik. The two of them walked down the hallway towards the stairs that would take them to the greenhouse. “Carl thinks he’s the King of the ARCH and his rule is law. I wouldn’t worry about him. Besides, the tribunal won’t convict you.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How do you know?” asked Jo through a sob. “Carl will make sure Rich only hears lies. Agatha doesn’t even like me.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“She doesn’t like any of the Engineers,” said Erik. “But she knows what we do is important.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“She doesn’t like me,” Jo repeated. “Two to one.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’re assum—,” Erik cut himself off. “Sorry, I … this isn’t the right time to be cute.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo stopped. “Siempre eres lindo,” she said through a thin smile. “It’s okay. I might have laughed at it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No, you wouldn’t have,” said Erik. They arrived at the door and he let her go down first. They descended the stairs slowly, Jo taking each step with a confident suspicion. They said nothing until they reached the bottom.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ellas me van a rechazar,” Jo said, looking at the gardeners.</p>



<p>“Huh?”</p>



<p>“They know,” said Jo. “They’ll hate me.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Why would that do that?” asked Erik. “You’re about the only person in this place who recognizes them. You know their names, where they came from.” As if in response, Jo’s name burst from within the plants. Heads popped up immediately behind the verge.&nbsp; whose arms were caked in dirt. Over a dozen leaped up, frantically rubbing the dirt from their hands and arms, and ran across the floor to Jo, all crying various things that Erik couldn’t understand. As they approached, Jo cringed defensively. “You know their life stories, Jo,” he said to her ear. “You’re a part of their family.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anita was the first to arrive. “¡Que el amor de Dios te proteja, Jo!” She wrapped herself around Jo and held her tightly. “Lo que necesites, solo tienes que preguntar.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>One by one, all of the gardeners held Jo and spoke. Erik stepped away as the crowd grew too large for him to remain near. With each person, Jo slumped a little less, smiled a little more. When the last had offered condolences and love, Jo looked at each of them, her face wet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Gracis, todos. Sin ustedes, soy nada,” said Jo. Her smile wavered and cracked, her face folded, and her strength fled. Jo fell to her knees and burst out in a wail that echoed throughout the cavernous space. “Soy nada!” she continued, as her friends gathered, surrounding her completely.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donner approached Erik. “Is she … okay?”</p>



<p>“No.” Erik held his arms around himself. “I don’t know if any of us will be.” &nbsp;</p>
