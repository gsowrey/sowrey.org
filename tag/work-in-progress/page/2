<p class="has-drop-cap">The drill was a dulled metal fingernail inexorably tearing apart manufactured stone, which slowly oozed out of the hole as a trickle of water mixed the dust into a slurry. The concrete, for it’s part, did all it could to bind the drillbit with chunks of rock and prevent progress. The four arms at the other end of the drill pulled against the wheel turning the gears that provided the torque, or pushed against a long lever that provided the forward force pushing the bit ever further into the reservoir wall. Every forty or so turns, the wheel would stop and the water level was checked. Every few minutes, hands would change between turning and pushing. The drillbit moved steadily inwards, millimeter by millimeter. When finally a depth was reached, marked by a clamp on the drill bit, the wheel was reversed, the drill pulled back, and a rest began. &nbsp;</p>



<p>It took nearly two hours to bore out the first inch-wide, twenty four inch-deep hole, another two for the second, the third was a four-hour slog due unmixed aggregate binding the bit.</p>



<p>“How many more do we have to do?” groaned Donner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Just one,” replied Jo, between gulps of water.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yay.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“On <em>this</em> side,” she added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ugh. Do I get an extra ration again?” Donner asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah,” replied Jo. “But that ain’t gonna help how much you’re gonna hurt tomorrow!” she cheered, adding a soft punch to his shoulder.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ow.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Vamos, let’s get this aligned for the last hole.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Already being aligned for the bracket, they only needed to lower the drill head a few inches until the tip of the worn bit pressed into the carefully etched markings on the concrete where the bracket would be mounted. The wheel started turning, the lever pressed forward, the scraping continued.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Can I … ask a question?” panted Donner on the wheel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You just did,” grunted Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Does that ever … get funny?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Nope,” Jo laughed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How did you … build this place … with tools this bad?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo laughed again from a place of experience and pain. “Kid, they weren’t always this bad. Remember when I said we ran out of gasoline?” Jo didn’t wait for Donner’s exhausted reply. “We had all the tools, all the things we needed. That was a long, long time ago.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Did you know … this many people … would come?”</p>



<p>“Here? We were never supposed to be here,” said Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The wheel stopped. “Huh?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m an Engineering student,” Jo reminded Donner. “We came out here for a course project.” Donner was caught somewhere between breathless and dumbfounded. “Keep turning,” she said spinning her finger around. Donner grunted and started turning again. “CEE 387A at Stanford,” Jo explained, “known as Arid Research Configurable Habitation.“</p>



<p>“ARCH,” breathed Donner.</p>



<p>“¡Sí! Back in ’07 Stanford hired Batesworth to create a new course that would teach techniques for living in a warming Earth. He was some structural genius, responsible for enough bridges to run from LA to Jersey. It was meant to be part practical and part research. That’s how Batesworth got his PhD, by the way, on the backs of his students’ work.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donner looked up. “He … cheated off you?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No, I wasn’t in his class until 2014. But there’s no way he could have gotten a doctorate without all the work his students did. And they did a lot.”</p>



<p>“They built this place?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo shook her head. “Maybe we should switch places.” Donner quickly let go of the wheel. Jo released the lever and took up turning while Donner pushed. “The ARCH we’re in now wasn’t the first ARCH. Every year Batesworth ran his course, he’d take the students out to a place about 20 miles northeast of here, on Navajo land. He had a deal with them that they could keep the buildings after the students were done. Every year, a new ARCH, a new design, a new challenge. There we were, middle of nowhere, just a geodesic dome on flat ground, surrounded by dry brush, snakes, scorpions, jack rabbits, and the odd coyote. Days were scorching and the nights were freezing. We learned fast.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So how’d you get here?” Donner grunted as he pushed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo turned the wheel a few moments. “That’s a longer story,” she finally said and stopped turning. She took a bucket and refilled the water tank.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We got time,” said Donner.</p>



<p>“Yeah,” Jo agreed, wiped her forehead, and resumed cranking. “We’d gone to Page to get some supplies. We were supposed to be self-sufficient, but Carl no puede agregar para salvar su estúpida vida—“ Jo caught her breath. “Discúlpame. Carl didn’t get enough food. We’d hoped to be in and out before Batesworth realized his students had screwed up … but Page was a disaster area. Sirens were everywhere, cops were out, people screaming, breaking windows, stealing shit. We drove back down the 98 so fast I thought the truck might fly apart. By the time we got back, Batesworth had already heard the news, all over the radio.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Armageddon.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Whatever it was,” muttered Jo. She looked at Donner. “You know we still have no idea what actually happened?” She shook her head. “We waited a couple of weeks for the craziness to die down. No-one knew we were out there, except for the Reservation, and they left us alone. When we went back to Page …” Jo took in a shuddered breath. “You would swear someone had bombed the place. Barely anything left. People came out of the woodwork, thinking we’d come to rescue them. They begged us to take them with us.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You took them with you?” asked Donner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We tried to tell them that we were living out in the desert, that we had very little to live on, and were looking for supplies. We thought we’d told them how bad we had it, and they’d leave us alone. Apparently, we were way better off than them. Twenty RVs, dozens of cars. A few hundred people. We had a small town almost overnight. And then the first winds came: rolled two RVs and tore a strip off our roof. The next day, the wind nearly destroyed the place. We were already in a losing battle. We used the RVs as wind breaks to keep the structure upright until the wind stopped so we could make repairs.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“But you had no supplies, did you? No way to make repairs with what you had. You … you couldn’t have just made due? You had to have found more … stuff.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Exacto,” Jo stopped cranking to fill the water tank again. “We hit every town between here and Flagstaff. Every thing we could find that wasn’t bolted down came back with us.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“But … what about all the people? Where they come from?”</p>



<p>“Well, how did you find out?” asked Jo. “Did your group follow us one time?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No, we didn’t see the ARCH until it was here. And by then, there were already thousands living here.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Everywhere we went to find supplies, we found people. Then we found more who were fleeing Phoenix, Tucson, Albuquerque, Vegas, SoCal, even Texas. Conditions had gotten so bad there that they all ran. We couldn’t stop them from following us like perros callejeros.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How did you end up here, then?” asked Donner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The ARCH we originally built could hold maybe a couple hundred, tops. We bolted on everything we could to make more space. People lived ten to a car, thirty to an RV. We needed to expand the ARCH. But the winds were so strong we couldn’t actually assemble anything. There was much dust in the air that blackout conditions were common. Sand dunes started to cover some of the vehicles. We didn’t know what to do. Then we found a hiker one morning, barely alive, who’d been blown across plateau from the Grand Canyon. When he recovered, he told us that the winds weren’t as bad in the valleys. That’s when Robert had the brilliant idea to move us here.”</p>



<p>“Who’s Robert?” asked Donner.</p>



<p>Jo stopped turning and leaned on the crank wheel. “Robert was…” She took a drink of water. “¿Cómo digo? Do you remember the best kid in your school? The one everyone liked? They were smart, one of the best basketball players, helped all the teachers?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donner smiled uneasily. “Yeah.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That was Robert. More than that. He was Professor Batesworth’s dream student. When we were trying to set up our tents on the first night, Robert was sketching out the structure we would build in the sand. When we were trying to erect the first structure, Robert had us do it in such a way that automatically roughed in plumbing and electrical space. We finished the project in nearly half the time because of his vision. Dios mío, Carl lo odiaba por eso. When we came here, Robert convinced us to build multiple Blocks, not just one. He’s the one who said we had to dig tunnels if we really wanted to survive. He pulled practical jokes all the time, tied bootlaces together, left snap-traps. He made the gardens grow. And he was so malditamenta misterioso, never telling us where he came from or what his parents did. He’d up and disappear without warning, sometimes for days.” Jo laughed almost resentfully. “Like one morning, after talking with the hiker? Robert took a motorbike and rode off into the wind. We thought he’d gone suicidal. He returned that night with a plan to move the ARCH to a safer place.”</p>



<p>“Move the <em>ARCH?</em> This place is huge!” Donner protested.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Remember, it was only Block 1 at the time. One of Batesworth’s project mandates was that anything we build had to be easily raised and torn down. So that’s what we did. We got everything that could roll back on the roads and drove through sandstorms to the North Rim. Took us nearly eighteen hours to drive a hundred and twenty miles. We lost two cars along the way. We rebuilt the ARCH as Block 1, adding Blocks 2 and 3 to house all the extra people who had come along. We thought we’d just wait out the season, wait for the weather to change, and break for the coast. We figured it was a better option than staying here.” She stopped and looked at Donner. “That’s when you arrived here, ¿sí? How did you find out about the ARCH?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I have no idea,” shrugged Donner. “We were in the Kaibab when we got texts that…” Donner trailed off. “My parents … they, uh, texted me. ‘We love you very much. Remember us.’” Donner withheld a sob. “A lot of the kids got messages like that. The cell signals all went dead a few moments later.” Donner wiped his eye, leaving a streak of thin mud where the dust mixed with his tears. “Mr. Hobart, our, uh, teacher, said it was only temporary and we’d be fine. We were supposed to go home a week later … but we couldn’t. Our homes were—“ Donner choked. Jo handed him a cup of water. “Thanks.” He took a shuddered breath. “Mr. Hobart teacher didn’t know what to do. We wandered, looking for food. Finally we decided to go north. We got to Tuba City when the bus ran out of gas.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo gasped. “You were stuck there? That place was un infierno.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It wasn’t that bad. By the time we got there, there was nothing except a lot of people, a lot of cars and trucks. Then somebody heard about a shelter someone had built on the North Rim. We scrounged gas from every vehicle we could find. The bus must’ve held a couple hundred.” Donner stared blankly. “Somehow, we got here.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We tore that bus apart,” Jo recalled. “It think the chassis made up the support of Block 7.”</p>



<p>“I remember a helicopter, too.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo laughed. “Oh, that. That guy was crazy. I’m amazed he made it here.” She looked at the drill. “Come to think of it, the motor ended up in the drill rigs.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>The two fell silent. Jo continued to look at the drill. Donner looked at the wall, then the girder, the the struts. Not far away, the gardeners harvested. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“How do you do it?” asked Jo.</p>



<p>“Do … what, me?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’re happy,” said Jo. “How…?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donner blinked, his head slowly slipped to one side and his vision trailed off to an indistinct point. “I’ve never thought about that. I … never thought about being anything. I … just am.” He looked at Jo. “You’re not, are you?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo sighed. “Jo, it’s hard enough being a woman in this place, never mind doing what I do.” She sat down hard on the ground. “You saw the guy in the nice shirt?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah.”</p>



<p>“That’s Batesworth. He’s a gilipollas.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A what?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“An asshole,” growled Jo. “He’s the Chair of Engineers, the one in charge. He hides in his little office believing he’s responsible for all the decisions. He acts like he’s still a professor, lords his professional certification over us. Meanwhile the rest of us run on our own trying to keep this place alive. That is one cabrón we can do without. He was here to inspect our work.”</p>



<p>“He didn’t like it.”</p>



<p>“He doesn’t like anything that’s not done to spec. But the specs never envisioned a place like this.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Jo!” called Erik from near the stairs.</p>



<p>“¿Que?” Jo yelled back.</p>



<p>“It’s time!” &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Joder,” Jo muttered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Who’s he?” asked Donner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Erik. Kind of the second guy in charge.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Is he a gilly-poy-ass, too?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Gracias a Dios, no,” said Jo, getting up. “Take a break, Donner.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What’s going on?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo stopped in her tracks and blew out a breath. “Remember the Robert I told you about?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The really smart guy?”</p>



<p>“We’re going to kill him.”</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">“Where are we going?” Donner asked as they stepped around the occupants of the hallway, most in a half-slumber. Jo kept walking. “Jo? Are you okay?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo stopped. “No.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donner hesitantly touched Jo’s shoulder. “What’s going on?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Robert Ferris was my classmate, a year my senior. He had enough credits to graduate, but he had delayed his own graduation to take Batesworth’s ARCH course. He and Erik were Batesworth’s right hands: Erik was the TA, Robert was … honestly, I think Robert was there to make Batesworth look good.“ Jo tried not to sob. “Robert and I had a lot of chats around the fire in those first few weeks. Random stuff. Movies, food, the places we would build after graduation, places we wanted to visit. He was almost like an older, awesome brother.</p>



<p>“After Block 2 collapsed, Robert was the one who realized that the ARCH was in worse shape than we’d thought. He’s the one who started digging the tunnels. Robert had the plans, knew the schedule, designed the tools. If he were still the one running the project, we’d have moved out of here by now.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So what happened? Why … why are you … why is this happening?” asked Donner. “What’s going on?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No lo sé.” Jo continued walking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donner followed quickly. “Jo?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I … I don’t know,” Jo spat, not turning around. “I don’t know what happened. I don’t know why it happened.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What happened?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo stopped as they entered Block 9. She looked down the hallway towards their destination. She could see others heading in the same direction. “Robert raped and nearly killed a girl.” Whether or not Donner made any sound, Jo didn’t recognize. “That’s what we were told. He’d snapped. Gone crazy. He was in the tunnels, they found him standing over her with her torn clothes and a bloody hammer. They beat him almost to death.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I—,” Donner shuddered. “I’m … sorry.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It wasn’t you,” said Jo quietly. “It wasn’t him,” she added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Huh?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“He didn’t do it. I know he didn’t.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So why—“</p>



<p>“Because,” Jo snapped. “Because. Because we let a friend down. And we’re all going to suffer for it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>They walked down the hallway until they got to the door of an unmarked room at the south-eastern edge of Block 9,&nbsp; one of only a handful of rooms in the ARCH had held no occupants. It was a room not originally conceived in anyone’s plans for the building, one no-one had ever wanted to build, prayed that it was never to be used. But every time the banshee screamed, the room would serve its purpose.</p>



<p>“Go back to the greenhouse,” said Jo, opening the door.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’ll wait,” said Donner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You shouldn’t,” she said, entering the room. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The room was roughly rectangular, with the far wall being a divider between the inner room and an outer space that opened into the outside. Robert stood against the divider, his wrists chained to a loop on the wall that kept him from moving in any direction. His shirt had been wrapped around his head, and gagged him from speaking. On either side of him were two large men with large spears, both pointed towards Robert’s torso. One of the spears had already made a mark, a cut deep enough to cause a trickle of blood to seep down Robert’s side, and to keep Robert from struggling. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo stepped up to Robert. She reached out to untie the shirt from his head and found the spear in her face. “¿Cuál es su problema?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Director’s orders,” said the large man with the pointy stick.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>Director</em>?” Jo asked. “We don’t have a ‘director’.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The guy in charge,” said the other spear-wielder.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The only thing he’s in charge of is the shit between his ears,” Jo muttered, just loudly enough that Robert heard. Jo could see the spasming of a laugh. “I’m sorry, Robbie. I tried to convince them that this was really, <em>really</em> stupid. Even if … even if you had done … <em>something</em>, which I don’t believe, we need you. We need you now more than ever. The Council’s gone to hell. Batesworth is so full of his own delusions that he’s letting Carl do anything he likes.” She let out a short chuckle of derision. “If anyone is a director,” she spoke loudly enough for the two guards to hear clearly, “it’s this guy. It’s a shame you’re too stupid to see it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Whatever, get back!” said the first guard, swinging his spear precariously close to Jo’s head.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m going to see that you spend a lot of time fixing toilets,” she growled as she stepped back against the wall.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Someone’s in a bad mood,” said a pleasant voice in Jo’s ear.</p>



<p>Jo instinctively leaped away and turned to see the voice’s owner. “Dawn!” Jo cursed. “Stop doing that!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dawn giggled. “Sorry, I can’t resist a good scare. You know me!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You pick the worst times for that,” muttered Jo. “What are you doing here?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Francis sent me,” sighed Dawn, “to be his witness.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“He isn’t coming?” Jo balked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No,” grumbled Dawn. “Francis and Carl are working on Batesworth’s orders, so they’re apparently ‘all tied up’.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Of course they are. Consign their friend to his death, don’t have the cojones to see it through.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I don’t want to see this through,” said Dawn. “Robert’s … this can’t be happening.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It shouldn’t be happening. Carl was so quick to damn Robert, he should be here.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Apparently they’re on strict orders.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“From who, Batesworth?” asked Jo.</p>



<p>“You didn’t hear?” asked Dawn. Jo shook her head. “Batesworth appeared in the tunnels a couple of days ago.”</p>



<p>“That, I know,” said Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“He wasn’t happy about the lack of progress.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“He’s not happy about anything right now,” Jo muttered.</p>



<p>“Well, Batesworth marched in about a half hour ago and ordered Carl to start moving people in today!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Today?!” Jo gasped. She looked up at the ceiling. “Dios mío, I think he actually listened for a change!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Carl and Smiley agreed. Then Carl freaked out to Francis.” Dawn leaned in close and whispered. “Francis told me that there’s no way they’ll do it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Wait, you mean they can’t do it, or won’t do it?” &nbsp;</p>



<p>“I don’t know. I don’t know what they’re doing,” Dawn sighed.</p>



<p>“Gah. Some men,” muttered Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Speaking of which,” said Dawn, glancing across the room.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The door had opened and in stepped Professor Batesworth, wearing his Stanford ceremonial robe: black, with red fabric on the sleeves past the elbows and in stripes down the front. He wore his eight-sided black cap. The attire stood out sharply against everyone else’s, as Batesworth had taken great care to keep the regalia in pristine shape. No-one had ever discovered why Batesworth had felt the need to take the regalia out into the middle of the desert.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Such a show off,” whispered Dawn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Batesworth walked to the middle of the room, followed by Erik. Erik looked despondently towards Jo. Batesworth unnecessarily cleared his throat, everyone else in the room already having given him their attention. Batesworth scanned the room, not really meeting with anyone else’s gaze. He produced a slate scrawled with a script — Batesworth never did anything official without a script — and held in front like a town crier. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Robert Ferris, you stand before your peers, convicted by the tribunal for the crimes of sexual assault and battery.” Immediately, Robert started grunting and groaning through the gag. Batesworth ignored the sound and spoke louder. “While these crimes carried harsh punishments in the World That Was, those of us who remain are unable to live with your blight.”</p>



<p>“‘<em>Blight</em>?’” Jo exclaimed. “This is wrong, Professor.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Batesworth ignored Jo and continued. “The Council has conferred and we hereby condemn you to banishment. You will leave the ARCH, never to return. You will live in the wild to the best of your ability. We leave you with a day’s rations, your clothing, and a knife. May God have mercy on your soul.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Robert’s muted screams hit a crescendo, screaming through his shirt, a series of roars and half-gags that would likely have been some kind of denunciation of Batesworth and the Council, and possibly all of humanity, had Robert been able to articulate himself. He was swiftly muted by a whack on the head by one of the spear-holders, Jo whimpered on his behalf. The room fell painfully quiet. There was at worst only a low lone whistle, the banshee apparently having gone to sleep. The outer walls, normally rattling in the winds, offered only a periodic rumble. Batesworth nodded and a door on the divider was opened. The two other guards lowered their poles at Robert, while Erik unhooked the chain that held Robert in place. Robert immediately tried to struggle, until he felt the dagger point under his chin. Surrounded by the pointed poles, he growled a final time, and went through the doorway. A small sack with the rations and the knife clinked in next to him. In a quick motion, Erik removed the chains and the door closed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A heartbeat later, coherent yelling began, along with the mad pounding on the door as Robert tried to break free. “I’m innocent! I didn’t do anything!! This isn’t justice, this is <em>murder!</em>”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Erik,” said Batesworth calmly. Erik nodded painfully and reached for a lever next to the door.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“WAIT!” Jo’s voiced ricocheted around the room. Erik’s hand stopped. “You can’t do this! <em>We</em> can’t do this! Professor Batesworth, this is wrong. What happened was wrong and we can’t change that, but we can change <em>this</em>. We can stop this from becoming even more of a tragedy. Please, for what good is left, we need to stop and rethink this before you regret it!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Your assumption, Ms. De Leon,” Batesworth said barely over his shoulder, “is that there is anything you say is worth hearing.” He looked towards Erik. “Now.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Erik, please, no!” Jo pleaded. Erik looked at Jo, at his hand, at Batesworth, and back to Jo. His hand vibrated in indecision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Now, Erik!” Batesworth demanded. “For the good of the ARCH!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>There was a scraping sound, followed by two shrieks — one in the outer room, one in the inner room — the sound of things sliding and desperate clinging, then only the buffeting of wind. Erik pushed forth on the handle. The buffeting stopped. Erik opened the door again, revealing that the room’s occupant had departed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dawn was holding Jo, who had collapsed to the floor. Jo’s eyes were trained on the empty space, her eyes vacant and wide. “Murderers,” she whispered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;Batesworth tucked his slate away no differently than at a Council meeting, turned, and walked out of the room, the two guards following. Dawn helped Jo to her unsteady feet, holding her for every ounce of support. Erik stood in the corner next to the handle, staring alternately between his feet and Jo. The wind whipped around beyond the walls, lightly rattling the hull plates. Beyond that, there was still a faint yelling, and the sound of rocks hitting the outer door. Jo stared at the door as if it could answer her unspoken question.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Jo,” said Erik softly. He stood next to her, gently placing his hands on her face. “Jo?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s not right,” she said. “None of it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I know. I … it doesn’t make sense to me. Robert wasn’t the sort. He was strong.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“He was stronger than all of us,” said Jo, still staring at the door.</p>



<p>“Was he?” Erik asked. “I mean, we all like to think we’re unstoppable. But we all have our breaking points. Maybe he reached his.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“¡Dáme un respiro!” Jo protested. “You <em>know</em> Robert! Did he ever seem upset to you? Did he even ever have a bad day? Robert was having <em>fun</em> with all of this! It was a challenge, a game to him. And he played it better than anyone.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dawn released her hold of Jo, and Erik took over, holding Jo tight. “Or maybe he just suffered in silence and kept the brave face for the rest of us. He was the guy who smiled at a disaster. He was the one who’d giggle at the terrible hands in poker, knowing he was just going to annoy us with it. He was—“</p>



<p>Jo broke away from Erik. “Stop saying ‘was’! He’s not <em>dead</em>, Erik! He’s still alive! He’s <em>out there! Right! Now!</em>” she stabbed her hand towards the outer wall.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik slumped. “Don’t think I don’t know that, Jo. I pulled the handle. I dumped my friend outside. We decided to let him go.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No, I didn’t decide. The rest of you did,” Jo snarled. She marched towards the door.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Jo! Wait!” Erik called.</p>



<p>“I need to go fix something,” she said as she spun through the doorway.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donner had been waiting patiently outside. He backed against the wall as Jo burst through the door; she didn’t acknowledge him as she roared past in angered silence. He quickly sprang after her as she turned the corner, as eager to stay with her as she was to distance herself from the events she’d witnessed. Donner wisely chose not to say anything to her until they were halfway into the Atrium, and she stopped.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Are you okay?” he asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo wheeled around, ready to tear off something vital. The futility of the instinct caused her to spring right back around.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donner took an unconscious step backward. “I’m sorry.”</p>



<p>Even with her back to him, even over the droning of the Atrium and the wind, Donner heard: “You didn’t do anything.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I can still empathize,” he said. “Even if I don’t understand what happened.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo’s head sagged, her shoulders shook in great hops. Then she suddenly threw out her arms, raised her head, and emitted a sound that the ARCH’s inhabitants usually only heard coming from the outside. It was deep, and powerful, and mournful, and vengeful. The Atrium fell nearly silent except for the sound of a thousand eyes following the screech to its source. The source didn’t care. She walked off solemnly, leaving Donner behind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She wanted to run, wanted to hide. She wanted to disappear. But in the ARCH, there were no places to hide, no places to be alone. There was always someone within an arm’s length of you, a paper thin barrier between your thoughts and someone else’s. And so Jo descended into the greenhouse, where the arms were more involved with creating and sustaining life.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">“Hola, Anita,” said Jo sadly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anita saw Jo’s face and dropped her gardening tools. “¿Que pasó, chica?” She walked quickly to Jo and held her tight. “Es Roberto, ¿no es así?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The great concrete wall around Jo’s heart shattered. Her face contorted, her eyes swelled, her throat tightened. It was all she could do to not wail. Anita held onto her friend, and refused to let go until Jo had finally gasped air.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Estoy bien, estoy bien,” Jo gurgled. She coughed and ahemed a few times. “Estoy bien,” she repeated quietly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No, no lo eres,” said Anita plainly. “Estás herido. Usted está en el dolor.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo took a great, shuddering breath. “Sí.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Lo desterrados, ¿verdad?” asked Anita. Jo nodded slowly. “¡Esos gilipollos! ¿De dónde creen que obtienen el derecho de decidir quién vive y quién muere?” She looked at Jo. “Disculpame. No era mi intención—“</p>



<p>a“Tienes razón,” said Jo. “Soy una gilipolla. Yo no hago oír. No me detuve ellos. Yo no &#8230; Yo no salvarlo.”</p>



<p>“¿Podría usted los ha detenido? ¿Puede usted imaginarse lo que habrían hecho a usted, si hubieras intentado?” Anita asked softly. In the greenhouses, the wind was barely a whisper. “Si intenta salvar a todos, que va a terminar perdiendo a ti mismo.”</p>



<p>Jo sighed. “Odio esta lugar.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Lo odiamos,” Anita smiled curtly and hugged her friend again. “Lo odiamos.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The lights flickered and the greenhouse was plunged into utter blackness. Annoyed murmurs from the various growers in the distance whittled up around the empty space, sounding like unseen skittering creatures. Jo gripped Anita tightly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“¡Jo! Demasiado fuerte!” grunted Anita and pulled an arm free. “¿Dónde está su luz?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>With a shaking hand, Jo reached down into her pants and pulled out a small hand-cranked flashlight. The batteries, well-used, still offered enough charge to light up around her. Jo immediately felt less clingy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Sorry,” Jo muttered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No se preocupe de mí, ir a arreglar las luces,” said Anita.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo walked quickly towards the stairs, before the batteries ran down. “You’ll be okay?” Jo asked, somewhat absently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“¡Es sólo la oscuridad!” laughed Anita as Jo disappeared into the stairwell.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main switch for the greenhouse lights was still engaged. Jo disengaged the switch, primed, and reengaged it. The darkness continued. The lights were on three upwards turns of the spiral staircase, which was moments before the batteries died on her flashlight. She went to the top, went out the door, and down the hallway to a heavy door with a large lock. She produced a set of keys from her pocket, and flicked through for the one marked with a lightning bolt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The breaker room was one of several oft-rebuilt things in the ARCH, having been moved four times from its original position in Block 1, and expanded countless times to manage the electrical input. It was easily the size of a delivery truck’s box and so heavily packed that only small people felt safe moving around inside. The room had metal grates for the floor and ceiling, relying on thermals to circulate air in the small space.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The smell of ozone was thick in the air, along with the unmistakeable scent of burnt wire casing. Jo grabbed a small extinguisher from a bracket on the wall. She had no idea if the thing would even work anymore, or even if she needed it. As no flame presented itself, and the smoke started to clear out, she traced the thinning vapor back to the greenhouse circuit. It looked like someone had taken a flame thrower to part of it, the section melted out, with drips of cooling molten copper on a breaker box beneath it.</p>



<p>Jo reached to a small metal box on her belt and slid out a multitool. It could almost have passed for one of those commercially-available folding models that could turn into pliers, except it was a fair bit wider, and could separate into two major parts. She unfolded a long, thin tool that she had once been told was a fish scaler and hook remover; Jo used it to poke around in things when her fingers wouldn’t fit. She used it to pry loose some of the fused wires and cables, to get a clearer idea of what had happened.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Mierda,” she cursed. She traced up the wiring, looking for the input circuits, no small task in a room built from countless shards of salvaged electrical parts and just as many segments of mismatched wiring, put together by people who hadn’t seen the inside of the <em>American Electricians&#8217; Handbook</em>, let alone had their ticket. The locus of the problem seemed to be nothing more remarkable than a short, albeit one that had fused nearly half a panel and burnt out most of the wiring attached to it. Jo scanned the panel labels and tried to line up the smouldering remains with what the previous crews’ had indicated. Jo grunted and headed out of the room to look for some help.</p>



<p>Jo nearly collided with “DONNER!” as she exited the room. She doubled over and breathed heavily. “Where did you come from?!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I, uh, I was following you.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo looked at him curiously. “Why?”</p>



<p>“In case you needed help?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo smiled as broadly as she could muster with a startled, broken heart. “Thank you, Donner. Thank you.” She reached out and put her hand on his shoulder. “I wish I had a dozen of you right now.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donner looked past Jo into the breaker room. He sniffed the air. “Is it bad?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’ve seen better,” said Jo. “We lost at least a couple feet of wiring, and the greenhouse has gone dark. We’ve got to get those lights back on, fast.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Can I…?” he pointed into the room.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Cuidado, some of that stuff is still live.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donner went into the room and inspected the damage. “Do we have wire?” Donner asked, with a notable excitement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Guess,” smirked Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re stealing again,” Donner concluded. “Who wired this with 10 gauge?! This should be at least 8.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So you know a bit about electrical?” Jo asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“My aunt was an electrician!” he beamed. “She taught me a lot. She’d be really ticked at whoever put this in.”</p>



<p>“Good,” said Jo, hovering at the door. “This repair is on you, then.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Hey Jo!” said Dawn, suddenly appearing at Jo’s side.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“¡Jesús María Madre de Dios en el cielo!” blurted Jo as she careened off the wall of the hallway. Dawn doubled over laughing. “Would you stop doing that!”</p>



<p>“Sorry!” she wheezed trying to catch her breath. “One moment!” She finally got to standing, and between the odd gasp, managed: “I heard the greenhouse had a blackout?”</p>



<p>“Puta,” muttered Jo. “Burnout in the breaker room, by the looks of it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Burnout??” Dawn poked her head through the open door and saw Donner negotiating a perfect distance from any electrical equipment. “Phew! That’s a lot of burned plastic.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s got to be a short,” said Donner from inside the room. “This wiring is… what the hell is this?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ugly isn’t it?” Dawn said. “I installed about half of it, and who knows who changed what since then. The last time I looked in there, it looked like someone had rolled up my granny’s rag quilt.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s worse than that,” said Donner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dawn eyed the young man. “And you get to make comments about my electrical setup, because…?” &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Because he’s a kid, didn’t know who he was speaking to, and frankly,” Jo tried to look apologetic, “he’s right. I dunno who’s been in there, but we’re going to have to tear out and redo most of the lines out to the lower levels. And some of the parts that haven’t melted out.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>Melted?</em>” squawked Dawn. “Why didn’t the breakers trip??”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Someone bypassed them on a few lines,” said Donner. “It looks like they wanted to run more amps than the breakers could handle.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Lemme take a look,” said Dawn suspiciously and got into the room. She went to the panel Donner was inspecting and poked at it. “Ouch!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Careful, it’s still hot,” said Donner. “I think there might still be a live wire in here somewhere.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“See that handle over there, the red one?” Dawn pointed to a large red handle on a box labeled ‘DANGER: DO NOT DISENGAGE’. “Pull the handle down.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Um…,” Donner paused, looking at the sign.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I know,” said Dawn. “Just do it.” She looked at Jo. “We’re going to need your light, Jo.” Jo quickly pulled her portable light out and started cranking on the generator handle. The light spurted to life just as a loud <em>clunk</em> killed the remaining lights in the small room. Moments later, a multitude of cries could be heard. “Donner, the power is now off to this room, you can safely touch anything.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’re sure?” he asked, holding his hand back instinctively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dawn reached past Donner’s hand and put hers right on bare copper. “I’m sure.” She looked at the wiring and snorted. “God, what a mess. I told them not to let anyone in here who didn’t know what they were doing. But noooooo let’s give every Engineer a key because they’re Engineers and they know how to wire a light socket.” Donner snickered. “I’m not kidding. There’s a lot of people who should have the keys taken away.” She stepped back and looked at the mass of melted metal and plastic. “Fuck this.” She started pulling out whatever wires were clearly no longer connected. “Jo, we’re going to need a lot of extra wire. And whatever fuses we can get.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I have no idea where we’re going to find all that,” said Jo. “Not without knocking power out to other places.”</p>



<p>“Francis has a bunch of wire he’s been making for the tunnels. Can you go get a spool?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Francis,” Jo repeated. “You want me to talk to your husband, who doesn’t like me, and tell him to give me something Batesworth said was for the tunnels.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dawn stopped. “Shit. You had to piss him off, didn’t you?” She tapped her foot while she thought. “Screw it, I’ll have to go get it. Phil at least will listen to me. Donner!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“While I’m gone,” Dawn pointed to the tangle of wires she’d pulled out, “get the rest of the junk unhooked so we can get this straightened out. Try to figure out where those high-amp lines are so we can regauge them properly. We’ll need … um … looks like eight, maybe ten bars to jump the lines. A couple dozen connectors. Wire cutters.” As Dawn headed out to the door, she stopped, placed her hands on Jo’s shoulders, and levelled a serious gaze. “Jo, keep the lights on!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Muy divertido.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Dawn headed off down the hall, her hand on the wall just ahead of her, feeling for the next door out; her memory of the ARCH’s hallways were the only thing that would guide her out until lights had been restored.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo cranked away at the hand-powered light while Donner pulled out the burned wiring. “I thought you were forceful,” Donner commented a few moments later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Try being around two dozen know-it-alls all the time who think they know better than you,” Jo replied. She switched hands on the crank. “You don’t survive around here being muy tímida.” She cranked away as Donner ripped out a large chunk. “If you call this surviving.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It could be worse,” said Donner. “Imagine being outside…” He stopped and dropped his head. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Don’t,” Jo nearly snapped. “It wasn’t you. You were… No te preocupes.”</p>



<p>“Can I…?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo finished Donner’s question. “Why did we banish Robert?”</p>



<p>“Sorry,” Donner nodded. “I… I don’t understand.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“He was a … he was found guilty of a crime,” said Jo. “A bad one.”</p>



<p>“Did he … kill someone?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No,” said Jo quietly. “Rape.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Oh.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next question didn’t come and filled the silence. “He was a good man. He … didn’t have to die.” Jo looked at Donner, who looked back, his hands still holding on to wiring. “I don’t know if he did it. I don’t want to believe he did. Robert was one of my friends. He was … he believed in this place. He wanted to do better. Someone like that doesn’t attack someone else. He never even raised his voice.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m s—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Stop saying that you’re sorry!” snapped Jo. “Disculpame. It … there’s just so much wrong right now that I just want to scream.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Okay,” Donner finally said. He turned back to the wiring. “Any chance you’ve got a screwdriver? I need to loosen some of these.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo thankfully stopped cranking the light. “Yeah,” and dug out her multitool. “Slot or Phillips?” She flipped out the slot bit. “It’s probably slot.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How did you ever manage to get this place working?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“On a wing and a prayer.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What’s with the lights?” came Erik’s voice from the door. He immediately saw the increasing pile of toasted wiring. “Oh boy, how bad?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Bad,” both Jo and Donner answered. Jo continued: “Another overload. Dawn went to get some wire so we can fix this.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What circuit blew?” asked Erik.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No se,” said Jo, holding the light for Donner. “But it took out the greenhouse.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Any idea how long until the lights are back on?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>There was a longer pause. “Well?” Jo asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Who, me?” asked Donner. “I’m not—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Remember what I said earlier?” asked Jo. “Let’s assume you’ve got the wiring. How long?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donner uhh’ed for several moments. “A couple of hours?” he said wildly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No offense — it’s ‘Donner’, right? — I’m tripling that estimate,” said Erik.</p>



<p>“I’m guessing a day,” said Jo. She leaned towards Donner and spoke lower: “A-plus for enthusiasm, C-minus for accuracy. This is going to be a <em>lot</em> of work.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik groaned. “I’ll let the Professor know.”</p>



<p>“If you want to be a real hero, cariño, make sure Dawn gets to stay in here. We’ll need her for this.”</p>



<p>“I’ll see what I can do.” Erik disappeared.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What if we can’t fix this?” asked Donner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re Engineers, Donner. We don’t have a choice.”&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Francis’ workshop was on the south side of Block 3, embedded into the canyon wall. It had originally been a shed attached to Block 1 after the ARCH had been moved, but as demand on the workshop increased with the ARCH’s expansion, the location was shifted to something more convenient. Although the move predated the start of tunneling as the ARCH’s replacement, its location proved to be more convenient, being closer to the tunnel’s entrance and exit. As usual, the doors were closed, a precaution Francis had required for safety; most assumed it was because he wanted to keep things from being stolen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dawn pounded on the door several times. A small slit <em>shlicked</em> open and a pair of eyes appeared. “Let me in, Phil,” said Dawn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What’s the password?” Phil asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“For fuck’s sake,” Dawn grumbled. “Let me in or I’ll put your nuts in the forge?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phil started to whine. “You know Francis wants pass—“</p>



<p>“Francis isn’t going to be getting <em>anything</em>,” she shrilled through the slot, “if he doesn’t open this door!” The door unlocked a moment later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Dammit, Francis!” Dawn said loudly as she entered the workshop. It was one of the larger rooms, filled with equipment that allowed fabrication and maintenance of tools and parts that kept the ARCH standing. The room was nearly thirty feet high, the walls were filled with shelves and racks that supported the remaining raw materials, sorted by their composition. A set of workbenches sat in the middle of the room. In one corner, there was a small pile of wood, much of it small sticks scrounged from outside. Longer poles of various lengths, mostly bent, stood in the opposite corner, next to another stand of metal pipes. Sheets of metal scrounged from abandoned stores and warehouses, buildings, including several from vehicles were organized into a rack, next to a huge cabinet of well-used plastic trays, containing nuts and bolts arranged by size and thread count. Against the far wall were a hand-powered grinding wheel, a human-powered bandsaw, and a smelter that needed no less than four people to operate. All were in use, adding to the heat and noise. Everything was covered in layers of red-brown dust from rock and corroded metal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Francis?” Dawn called out. There was no response. “Francis!” She went over to a door towards the back of the workshop. It was, as usual, locked. “Phil!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah?” Phil had returned to his job, assembling shoring for the tunnels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Where’s Francis?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phil shrugged his shoulders. “I dunno, he went off with Carl for something.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dawn shook her head as she walked over to Phil. “And you didn’t think to mention that when I came in?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I thought maybe he came back?” It wasn’t a question so much as ‘please don’t hit me’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You guys made some electrical wire. Where is it?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Storeroom?” Phil shrugged again. Dawn marched back to the door at the back of the shop and started to unlock it. “Hey, uh, Dawn? Francis doesn’t want anyone—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I need wire,” Dawn explained annoyedly. She flung the door open and went in. The room was large, easily twenty feet on a side, filled with makeshift shelving, the shelving filled with boxes, tools, smaller supplies, bolts, and things awaiting use, including rough spools of wiring. Dawn spied one immediately and inspected it. “Hmm. We’ll have to twist that too much.” She spied another one a bit further back, dismissing it immediately as being the same. “Phil! Where’s the heavy wire?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phil, still outside the door, glancing constantly over his shoulder, pointed to another part of the shelving. “Over there,” he said, then adding more quietly: “Next to those boxes.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dawn went to the shelf and tried to pull out a heavy bundle of wire. The boxes that Phil had quietly indicated were enough in the way that she had to try to push them out of the way. Refusing to budge, she called again: “Phil! Gimme a hand!” Phil looked as if he were about to be eaten by a lion. “C’mon!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I, uh, Francis doesn’t want—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Do you like eating, Phil? Are you hungry?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Well, yeah…?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The lights are off in the greenhouse. No lights, no food. I need this wire to get the lights back on, now get your ass in here!” Phil slunk into the room and quickly bolted his way to Dawn. They each took a grip on a wooden box and heaved it off the shelf and onto the floor with a loud clinking. Dawn looked down at the box, the top covered with an old rag. “Honestly, you guys should just melt that crap and get us some more tools,” she muttered, hauling the wire bundle out.</p>



<p>“We, uh, should put this back. Francis doesn’t like things—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I know, I know!” Dawn spat. “I married the twit, <em>remember?</em>” The box back in its place, Dawn heaved up the wire and made for the door. She got about halfway through when she snapped her fingers. “Cutters. Damn. And insulation. Bars. I can’t carry all of this. Phil!” Phil cringed. “Gimme a hand.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I—“</p>



<p>“Now!”&nbsp;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>“Are you sure?” asked Jo as she shone the light as far up the cable run as she could. “There’s nothing else up there?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There’d better not be, or this will be a really short…,” Dawn stopped herself, “I nearly punned that, didn’t I? If we missed something, there’ll be one helluva bang.” She took the crank-light from Jo and looked up again. “Donner, did you see anything else that looked disconnected?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donner was just outside the door, still brushing dust and cobwebs from his hair and clothes. “I don’t know if anything up there was wrong,” he said through a cough, “but I didn’t see any loose wires.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Here’s hoping then,” said Dawn, going over to the master switch. She primed it three times, then took hold of the switch. “Hold onto your butts.” She pulled the arm down to a satisfyingly solid <em>clunk</em>. There was the briefest hint of ozone. Dawn looked around. “Well, that’s a good sign. Jo, flip the first breaker.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo reached out to the breaker, one of a few remaining original ones. She flicked it with a gritty <em>chunk</em>. The light came on in the breaker room. “Also a good sign. Turn on the others?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah,” said Dawn, starting to pick up all the tools and debris. Another <em>chunk</em> was followed moments later by distant cheers. “I think this’ll hold, at least for now.” <em>Chunk.</em> “With any luck, no-one’s hotwired anything into the lines.” <em>Chunk</em>. “Which reminds me, how much of that wire is left?” <em>Click</em>. “Jo?” Dawn turned to see Jo seizing, her hand in a death grip on the metal railing that formed the room’s interior. “JO!” Dawn dove for the master switch and slammed it off. There was a disgruntled <em>bang</em> followed by disgruntled cries as the lights went out again. “JO!” Dawn leaped at Jo, who stumbled and fell to her knees. Dawn grabbed Jo by her shoulders. “Jo! Jo, can you hear me?” Jo’s eyes wandered, neither focusing or locking onto anything. “DONNER!”</p>



<p>Donner was already in the room from the screaming. “What happened?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Get Kelly, quick!” Dawn ordered. Donner was already halfway out of the room and raced down the hallway. “Jo, c’mon, don’t you dare leave me.” Dawn shook Jo lightly. The light on the floor cast ghastly shadows across Jo’s face and onto the ceiling. Dawn reached for Jo’s neck and felt around for a pulse. Her fingers moved between the carotids on either side of Jo’s neck, hoping a new position would find something.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo emitted a tightly withheld whisper that could have passed for someone letting the air out of a rubber balloon by pulling the valve tight, except when heard from across a field. Jo slumped forward onto Dawn, who carefully guided her friend to the floor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No, no, no no no no no!” Dawn tapped Jo on the face, at first lightly, then with more desperate strokes. Jo steadfastly refused to respond. “Jo!!” Dawn felt for breath, held Jo’s wrists, listened to her chest. Everything was silent. She quickly got up on her knees, laid one hand over the other with her heel into Jo’s sternum, and started pumping rapidly, counting under her breath. She then bent down, clamped Jo’s nose shut, propped her mouth open while tilting back her head, and clamping her lips over Jo’s mouth, blew hard twice. Dawn went back to chest compression, repeating her strokes. “You are not dying on me, you bitch!” Jo’s hand spasmed and latched onto Dawn’s arm. Dawn stopped and bent over. “Jo? Jo! Can you hear me??” Jo’s eyes found Dawn and pleaded. “What? Can you breathe?” The faintest of shakes of Jo’s head was all Dawn needed, and rolled Jo on her side and smacked her back with the flat of her hand. Jo coughed, wheezed, and drew in a painful breath on her own. The wheezing continued for several breaths as Dawn rubbed her friends’ back. “Jesus!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Lord… vain…, “gasped Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Whatever, you’re alive.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Called… me… bitch…”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Takes one to know one,” Dawn’s voice shook almost as much as her hands. &nbsp;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>“As usual, you’re wasting my time,” said Kelly, getting to her feet, unplugging the stethoscope from her ears. “You’re fine.” Her shadow bled into the void of the darkened hallway.</p>



<p>“She damn near <em>died</em>, Kelly!” Dawn retorted, kneeling next to Jo.</p>



<p>“And she would have, if it weren’t for you!” said Kelly. She looked to Jo, who was propped against the hallway wall. “I’m going to give this to you as being lucky, by the way. If you were alone, you’d be dead.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Would it feel less painful?” Jo muttered, trying not to rub her sternum. “How long until the tingling goes away?” She flexed her hands and tapped her fingers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How many volts did she get?” Kelly asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Not sure,” said Dawn. “We don’t exactly have standardized electricity. And something definitely went wrong in there. One-ten wouldn’t have jolted Jo that badly.”</p>



<p>“Take it easy for a day,” said Kelly. “And I mean that, Jo. <em>Seriously</em>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Lo se, lo se,” Jo held up her hand to stave off Kelly’s nagging. “I promise, nothing serious.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“And keep thanking her,” Kelly pointed at Dawn as headed into the darkness. She had only gone two steps when the lights snapped back on. “Good, I hate climbing those damned stairs in the dark.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You find it?” Dawn called into the breaker room.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think so,” Donner replied. “It wasn’t easy looking with a lantern.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Just be glad that one still works. Any idea what happened?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think we accidentally wired two lines together.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dawn threw her head back. “Dammit! Junior mistake!” she admonished herself. “Look for any others!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I did. I’m just checking before I throw the rest of the switches.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Be careful!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If I didn’t know any better,” Jo coughed, “I’d say you like him.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I just don’t want to make you run to get Kelly before he dies,” said Dawn. She rolled over and slumped against the wall next to Jo. “I’m really sorry. I can’t believe I made that mistake—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo gripped Dawn’s hand, though not particularly firmly. “No hay problema, hermana. If I had a penny for every mistake I’ve made, we could rebuild the ARCH out of copper.”</p>



<p>“I nearly killed you!” Dawn protested.</p>



<p>“Tell your husband you avenged him for all the times I’ve called him ‘Frank’.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Bitch,” Dawn replied.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Perra.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Slut.”</p>



<p>“Puta.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dawn dug her arm under Jo and pulled her close. “Just promise me one thing: you won’t leave.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Hermana, the banshee herself couldn’t drag me away.” Dawn hugged Jo tightly. “However,” Jo grunted, “you might kill me first if you don’t stop squeezing me so hard.” &nbsp;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>The cheers subsided after a few moments as the last <em>chunk</em> announced the restoration of power. The distant moaning howl resumed its position as the dominant sound. “That should do it,” said Donner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“At least until the next breaker blows,” said Jo. She stood unsteadily. “Let’s hope that’s after we get everyone into tunnels and we have to take all of this apart.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I wish we could change the lock on this door,” said Dawn, shooing Donner from the breaker room and locking the door behind him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Would it matter?” asked Donner. “None of those lines had any rating and I’m pretty sure you’re not supposed to link up so many breakers on a single circuit like that.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dawn looked at Jo. “Is he always such a know-it-all?” she asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Fits right in, doesn’t he?” said Jo with a wink at Donner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If you don’t need me anymore, I’ll go back … to …” Dawn chewed on a lip for a moment and looked back at the breaker room door. “I wonder how many other circuits could use an overhaul?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You know Carl’s going to be hunting for you now that all the lights are on,” said Jo. “You can’t hide from him for long. He’ll just go through your husband.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dawn sighed. “Yeah, I know. Ugh. Back to the blackboards.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Thanks again, Dawn. The help was definitely needed,” said Jo.</p>



<p>“You could have done without the jolt,” said Dawn.</p>



<p>“Well, it’s been too long since I had a cup of coffee. A thousand volts can’t be too far off, right?” Jo smirked. “Besides, I got the rest of the day off, now.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donner looked confused. “Er, does that mean I go back to general labor?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Nope,” smiled Jo. “You get to turn the drill crank.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Oh.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Jo pounded on the workshop door, each time cringing from her weakened hands hitting the metal. The slot slid open and a pair of eyes peered out.</p>



<p>“¡Hola!” said Jo. “We need some brackets.”</p>



<p>“Uh huh,” said the eyes, which were attached to Bob. “We’re busy.” And the slit slammed shut.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Batesworth sent us!” Jo shouted at the door.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donner’s face screwed up. “He did? When did he—“ He found his face covered with Jo’s hand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The slit opened again. “Brackets for what?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Girder mounts on the reservoir wall, so we can keep the ARCH from sliding,” said Jo. “Francis didn’t tell you?” The slit closed again. Heavily muted voices discussed something, then the locks on the door disengaged. The door opened and Jo stepped through, waving Donner to follow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The workshop was busy, two people working at the grinder, one turning with the other sharpening pickaxes. One man was walking in the hamster wheel that powered the bandsaw while another was slowly cutting away at a sheet of metal. The room rumbled with the sound of the smelter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Where’s Francis?” asked Jo.</p>



<p>Bob looked like someone has just asked him to translate into Swahili. “I was told to get more shoring!” He threw his hands up and walked over to a stack of premade shoring sections leaning up against the wall. He heaved one up and headed towards the door. “I dunno, ask Phil!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ask Phil what?” asked Phil, appearing like a gopher from the shelving.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Whatcha need?” Phil asked, coming around.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Five flat shackles for mounting girders, eight shackle pins, and eight one-inch concrete bolts,” said Jo. “Preferably steel.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phil whistled. “That’s a lot, Jo. We might have a flat shackle for girders, but if you want concrete bolts, you’re talking a plate on a wall?” Jo nodded. “We’ll have to cast that. I’m not even sure we have enough scrap to melt.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We do,” said Francis, exiting the storeroom. He drew the heavy bolt and locked it into place. “Barely, but I’m pretty sure we’ve got the stock. You got specs?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I can draw them out,” said Jo. “Three of the brackets will need to be dual, and three will be mounted to the support struts.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Oof,” Phil blew. “I think we might have the bolts, we had to make a bunch for Smiley. But those dual brackets will be beasts, that’s going to take a couple of days, at least. Building the negatives will be hard.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I can help with the wax model,” offered Jo. “Anything to get us casting quickly. We don’t have a lot of time.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We can’t get you casting for a few days,” said Francis, shaking his head. “You heard Rich, he wants people moved in those tunnels. We’re turning out the shielding as fast as we can.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“C’mon, Frank, we need those brackets!” Jo protested. “Rich said this was a priority, too. We have to do something before the slip goes too far and the girders won’t fit!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I told you, the smelter’s in use!” he shot back angrily. Jo looked at the smelter, which although hot, looked decidedly unused.</p>



<p>Jo bit her tongue. “How long until we can get <em>something</em>?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A few days,” Francis replied, turning away. “I’ll let you know as soon as we can deal with it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Frank, we don’t have the time!” Jo argued. “The slip is moving nearly two centimeters a week. At that pace, we have only a couple of days—”</p>



<p>“Go away, Jo!” Francis ordered. “We’ll move as quickly as we can, but I can’t do anything for you now!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Now you listen to me!” Jo marched after Francis. “I have a priority need, here!”</p>



<p>Francis wheeled around. “Why is this about you, huh? What about ‘we’? What do you think we’re doing here?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“All I do is ‘we’, Frank!” Jo spat, walking up to her opponent. “I make sure things get fixed so <em>we</em> have a roof over our heads! And I can’t do that if you block the things I need! No brackets, and the struts could give way. How many thousands do you want hurt, Frank?” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Francis shoved her hard, sending her onto the floor just in front of the smelter. “I said <em>leave!</em>” The smelter seemed to roar in agreement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donner raced to help Jo, she waved him off and propped herself up. “What’s up, Frank?” she asked, rubbing the shoulder she’d landed on. “You used to be a part of this team, always helpful. I could rely on you for pretty much any weird thing, no matter how small. Something’s changed. ¿Que esta pasando, amigo?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Nothing. I have work to do,” he said, not turning around. “And my name is <em>Francis</em>!”</p>



<p>“Sure, <em>Frank</em>,” Jo muttered. She flipped up onto her knees to stand, and then spied a small circle of dull yellowy metal on the floor. She picked at it, breaking it loose. It had a bare lustre, though shone when she scratched it with her thumbnail. “What’s this?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What’s what?” Francis asked testily.</p>



<p>“This isn’t aluminum, or steel,” she held it out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Francis looked at the blob in Jo’s hand, and looked a good shade whiter than before, a notable effect since no-one had stood in the sun for years. He snatched the small pebble of metal away. “It’s nothing. Just some brass from brazing solder. Now will you let us get back to work? Take some wax,” he threw his arm towards some dark orange blobs that sat on a shelf, “make your shackle models, and we’ll cast them as soon as possible. I’ll … I’ll make it a priority.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Scout’s honor?” Jo snarked as Francis walked away. She went over to the shelf with the dark orangey wax. She picked up three, and one to Donner. “Grab that patternmaker’s ruler?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The what?” Donner followed Jo’s finger and failed to find her target.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“See that ruler that has two scales?” Donner picked up the indicated tool. “Yeah, that. C’mon, kid, we have some carving to do.” They walked to the door as Phil came in behind them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Seriously, Phil, what’s going on with Francis?” asked Jo.</p>



<p>“Well, y’know,” said Phil.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No, Phil, I don’t know,” Jo replied.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phil looked around and leaned in. “It’s something about how the shares are being given out. I think Carl told Francis they’re keeping more and that’s got a few people real upset.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo blinked absently. “Shares? Shares in what?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phil blinked flounderly. “Y’know, uh, the tunnels — the rooms! — the shares in the spaces, the space we get, y’know, our rooms.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Really?” Jo asked. “Francis hasn’t mentioned that. Or Carl.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Well—“</p>



<p>“Or Professor Batesworth.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phil stammered silently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo nodded. “I’ll make sure to ask them at the next Council meeting. Thanks for the info, Phil.” She and Donner walked out the door, which was quickly closed and latched behind them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What was that about?” Donner asked when they were well beyond hearing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Un buen pregunta. Even with what Dawn said earlier, Frank’s in a weird mood,” said Jo. “And if that was brass, I’m the Queen of Spain.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What was it?” asked Donner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m not sure. I know what a drop of brass brazing looks like, and that wasn’t brass.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So … what do we do?” asked Donner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“About Frank? <em>We </em>are doing nothing. Right now, I need you to start carving out the models for the shackles. You know what they need to look like,” said Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What if I make a mistake?” asked Donner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo cast Donner a sideways glance. “It’s wax,” she said. “We just melt it and carve it again.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Oh, right,” said Donner, feeling a little foolish and a lot relieved. “What are you going to be doing, then?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I need to have a chat with Professor Batesworth. I have a feeling I’m out of the loop on something.”</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Jo knocked on Batesworth’s door frame. “Rich? Got a minute?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Batesworth was hunkered over his desk, looking at something Jo couldn’t see. He opened a drawer, tucked whatever it was away, closed the drawer, then turned to look at Jo.</p>



<p>Jo tucked her hands in front of her. “Reminiscing?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A little,” Batesworth admitted. “Are you here to complain about Carl? Because you can go right back out that door, I don’t want to hear it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo restrained a bristle. “I don’t think so?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Batesworth looked as if he were leaning back in his rigid chair. He folded his arms. “If it’s not Carl, then it’s something collapsing.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re working on bracket moulds for casting now. We should have something mounted soon, that should help keep things in place.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Well, you’ve got your act together,” said Batesworth, adding “for once” just enough under this breath that Jo could hear. “So this is a social call?” There were never social calls in the ARCH.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo breathed through the comment. “I was wondering if you could tell me what my share is? No-one else has told me.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Batesworth’s eyebrows knitted. “Share? You mean like a stock market share?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo shook her head. “I don’t know. I was talking with the guys in the workshop while we were getting our pattern blanks, and they mentioned that Francis and Carl are changing the shares and people were getting upset.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Batesworth’s eyebrows knitted further, a deep groove forming between them. “So this <em>is</em> about Carl…”</p>



<p>“Not … exactly. Not why I’m here, anyway. I just want to know what the shares are about. They said it was about rooms? I didn’t think we were allocating personal spaces like we did before.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Batesworth shook his head. “I swear you kids keep finding ways to confuse me more every day.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m 31, Rich, I’m not a kid anymore.”</p>



<p>“None of you have real-world experience beyond this project—“</p>



<p>“This is not a project anymore, Rich! It hasn’t been for a decade! You keep saying that we haven’t changed, but you’re just as much stuck in the past! We all are! All we’re doing in here is getting older.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Fair point,” Batesworth nodded. “Running around an endless loop certainly does wear on one’s perspective after a while.” They looked at each other a moment before Batesworth’s memory triggered. “Shares.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yes.”</p>



<p>“I have no idea what you’re talking about.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So we’re <em>not</em> reserving spaces for Engineers?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’ve never discussed it in Council, nor has Carl ever mentioned it to me at any time.” Batesworth leaned around Jo. “Erik?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“He’s out.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ask Erik, maybe it’s something that Carl’s brought up with him and it hasn’t come to Council yet.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I doubt that, Erik tends to bring things like this to Council. He doesn’t like it when one of us makes plans without involving the rest,” said Jo. “And it sounds like Carl and Francis have been discussing this quite a bit, it’s got Francis on edge.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’re being nice,” said Batesworth. “You keep calling him ‘Francis’.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You had a point, Professor, I am being una joda.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’ll assume that means you’re apologizing for your comments earlier.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was Jo’s turn to pause. “No. I won’t.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The Council made a decision—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That doesn’t mean the decision was right!”</p>



<p>“It’s not your place to challenge it, Ms. De Leon!” Batesworth commanded. “Judgement was passed by a tribunal. Do you or do you not recognize the validity?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Of the tribunal or the trial?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They are one in the same.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No they aren’t! One is a group of people and one is a process carried out by that group of people!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You can’t have the latter without the former, and there’s no point in having the former if you have no intention of the latter.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Oh, this is pointless!” said Jo. She turned to leave. “¿Por qué vine aquí?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You were asking about ‘shares’, whatever those were.” Batesworth saw the look on Jo’s face. “Something wrong?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You know Spanish? You know what I just said?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Vivo aquí diez años. ¿Crees que no aprendo un poco de español?”</p>



<p>Jo smiled. “Cercano, pero no del todo.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m sorry?” Batesworth asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No, I am, Rich. I didn’t give you credit for trying. Your Spanish might not be fluent, but that’s miles better than just about every other gringo.” She added with a nod: “Gracias.”</p>



<p>“De nada,” smiled Batesworth. “Remind me about the shares tomorrow in the Council meeting. Maybe Carl will be able to shed some light on it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Will do.” Jo again turned to leave.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How are the repairs coming?” Batesworth asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Like I said, me and Donner are carving out the shackles for the walls. Even if we finish quickly, we won’t have them before tomorrow.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Donner?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Remember the kid by the reservoir the other day?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ah, your help,” nodded Batesworth. “Then I won’t keep you. Hopefully you get those shackles quickly and we can stabilize the slide. Which also reminds me…”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Don’t ever call me a ‘hijo de las mil putas’ ever again.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">When Jo woke up in the morning, two thoughts crossed her mind immediately. The first was that she had actually <em>slept</em>, which both thrilled and terrified her. She couldn’t remember the last time she felt even remotely rested. She was sore in a variety of places, which in and of itself wasn’t unusual, though her hands cramped considerably from carving the first wax block. It had been delivered to the workshop for casting, and she and Donner had gone onto the next set of holes for the next shackle. Jo couldn’t even remember coming back to her little bed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second thought sparked almost lock-in-step with the first thought: she’d slept because it was deathly quiet. The lights were out. The wind had stopped.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Everyone had noticed the lack of wind. Constant sounds usually weighed on the human psyche like a thumb over the end of a running garden hose. It was so omnipresent that the sudden lack of the sound left an uneasy feeling, almost everyone exhibiting the kind of nervousness of trench warfare soldiers when the shelling stopped. As she picked her way out of her room and the room beyond, Jo noticed everyone looking up, as if expecting the ceiling to fall in at any moment. No-one talked, the only other sounds were random bare whisper. Ears strained for the slightest sound.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Engineering office was unsurprisingly full. Most of the Engineers and Apprentices had shown, expecting there to be some kind of an announcement, proclamation, marching orders, <em>something</em> to mark the occasion of there being no wind. The room was barely illuminated, battery lights providing limited harsh illumination, casting monstrous shadows across the ceilings and walls. Several people hovering at the door, unable to get inside. Jo could see Erik fielding several streams of questions, Professor Batesworth was engaged in a debate with two rather religious Engineers who were trying to communicate their prophetic fears. The noise in the office was the polar opposite of the outside.</p>



<p>“Hey!” shouted Jo. Only the person next to her took notice, though it was to determine how much louder he had to yell. “¿En serios?”</p>



<p>“Erik!!” she yelled louder, waving her hand-cranked light. Erik was so preoccupied with his assignment board and the fifteen people badgering him that he could barely hear the people next to him, let alone see Jo in the hallway. “We are going to get nothing done like this!” &nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>¡TRANQUILO!</em>” Jo shrieked, immediately silencing the small room. The people nearest to her cringed and instinctively looked up for a moment. “Yes, the wind has stopped. You want orders? Then listen up! I need at least five people to come with me outside to help check for damage and make repairs before the wind comes back.” Jo looked at Erik. “Unless, of course, someone has a better idea?” Erik nodded with the slightest of smirks. “We need at least ten more people to go out scrounging down the hill to see if there’s anything blown off that we can reuse. Anything else is pointless. Any questions?” It took a moment for the room to react, then a few people ducked into the hallway, a few started a quieter conversation, and the rest started to filter back out to their respective assignments. When Jo got into the hallway, she found over twenty people waiting, including Dawn and Donner. Erik stood at the doorway. “Okay, listen up, because I’m only saying this once,” said Jo, feeling for a moment like the stereotypical drill sergeant. She quickly pointed at nine people. “You people are with me. The rest of you head down to Block 9, open the drop in the burial room, use the ladder to get in and out. If it looks remotely useful, bring it back. Waste not, want not. If you even think the wind’s starting to pick up, drop everything and run. ¿Esta bien?” The group nodded and headed off.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the twelve scroungers headed off, Jo turned to the group of eight. “This is the first time in about a year that the winds have stopped. That means we have a very rare window to check for any damage outside. Some of it we know about, and I’m sure there’s a lot we’ve never seen. The goal is to find as many of these problems as we can, fix as many as we can, and at the very least mark where they are so we can fix them later when the wind comes back. Understand that the roof is a dangerous place. We’ve patched probably a third of it. That means there’s hundreds of places you can trip, and probably a few places where you might fall through. If you see a patch covered in sand, take a few moments to check it before you walk on it, and brush sand away to see how deep it is. Deep sand isn’t a concern — it’s been there a while and it’ll continue to be there. Thin sand is because the wind hasn’t blown it away. It might be covering up a potential problem. If it’s less than a knuckle deep, check for cracks or breaks. If it’s more than a knuckle, move on. If you’re not sure, find me and we’ll figure it out together. I will be working at the north side of the canyon, working between Blocks 3 and 6, to move a girder. I’ll have Donner,” Jo waved towards her Apprentice, “with me. If you see him, I won’t be far away. If you don’t see either of us, we’ll probably be in the lower levels moving the girder towards the reservoir wall. Are there any questions?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>One hand went up. “What happens if we do find a problem?” asked an older man, whom Jo assumed was also an Apprentice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You fix it,” said Jo, matter-of-factly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What if we don’t know how?” asked the man.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo groaned. “How many of you have repaired the roof?” Only two hands went up. “Okay… um … Dawn! You find either me or Dawn!” Dawn raised her hand to attract attention. “Any other questions?” The group was silent. “Okay, we’re heading outside <em>now</em>. It’ll be a bit breezy, it’ll likely be dusty. If you have a strip of fabric, wrap it around your mouth and nose to keep the dust out. If you don’t have a strip of fabric, <em>make one.</em>”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Jo…,” said Batesworth from the door.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo turned around. “Yeah?”</p>



<p>“I’m not going to thank you for barging in here and ruining our planning session,” said Batesworth, clearly enough for everyone to hear.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“And how long were you all planning?” Jo asked. “All those who saw a plan, please raise their hands?” Everyone in the hallway looked blankly at anything except Jo or Batesworth. “Nice planning, Rich.”</p>



<p>“You’ve got four hours. After that, we need those people back,” said Batesworth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah!” said Carl, coming from behind Batesworth. “Those are <em>my</em> people! I need them digging!” He spoke louder to the group. “Don’t do anything fancy. If it’s not critical, leave it alone. Get back to the tunnels as soon as you can.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If anyone wants to live long enough for Carl to open the tunnels so we can move, I suggest we start getting outside. This roof is the only thing keeping us alive right now, whether we want to believe it or not.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I need those people—!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They’re not cattle, Carl, they’re <em>Engineers. </em>Go get some general labor,” Jo sneered as she and the volunteers walked away. “I did!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The exit to the roof was at the top of Block 1, a staircase that was built into an outcropping of rock. Not so much a door as an removable roof panel, it took nearly five minutes to unbolt it. Before them, the ARCH’s roof extended away like a slowly rolling field of sand and exposed sheeting. Originally transparent polycarbonate panels, the majority of the ARCH’s roof was metal sheeting of nearly every variety, broken up in sections of increasing randomness as the roof descended towards the distant Block 9. Across the expanse were two dozen large turbines, manufactured from jet engine housings, industrial fans, and alternators, which sat in the winds to generate electricity for the ARCH; they were all motionless. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Stick to the chords whenever possible!” Jo told the group, indicating the straight lines that formed the roof’s tessellation. “That’s where the strength is. Try not to all walk in the same spot at the same time, spread yourself out at least a body length between you. If you have to walk on one of the panels, try to spread your weight out, and be extra careful of it’s patched, some of the patches weren’t put in properly. If you get in to trouble, yell.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The group broke up into three groups of two, each heading in a different direction, leaving Jo, Donner, and Dawn. Jo led the way over to the side of Block 3. The air smelled of dust and was painfully dry. They walked slowly and carefully, their feet testing constantly for strength and traction. It took them nearly fifteen minutes to walk the few hundred feet to where the metal roof cladding met the rock wall.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Well, on the bright side, it’s a tight fit,” Dawn commented. “But we’ll have to remove a panel to get that girder out. I can’t see any other way.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo sighed. “I figured as much. It’s just more time than I thought, and I’m not sure how much time we’ll have.” She looked at the sky, unable to see much to the west past the rim of the canyon. The east sky was a flat beige, without a single fleck of texture or difference in shade. Nothing could offer a hint of the weather’s future. “Dawn, can you go get a rope from Frank’s shop? Donner, I need you to stay here. I’m going inside to loosen the panel.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dawn and Jo headed back inside, moving a bit more quickly, retracting their steps on the dusty roof. Donner leaned against the rock wall for security. Once down the stairs, Dawn headed to the workshop while Jo headed to the north side of Block 3 and the final girder. When she removed the panel, she saw Donner and Dawn wave back. Dawn handed down the rope, which Jo tied through one of the girder’s eyes. The three of them hauled the girder up through the hole, then Jo replaced the panel and headed back outside.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She had only made it up to the edge of Block 1 when the lights started to flicker back to life. Jo stopped and craned every sense she had. Beyond the periodic shuffle-thump of people on the roof, there was no sound of the wind that had grown strong enough to start turning the turbines. “Please, we need more time,” she prayed, and broke into a sprint for the stairs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once again on the roof, Jo took a brief moment to look around, to make sure no-one needed her help. She could only see two of the three roof crews. “Where are the others?” she called out. The members of the other crews looked about, but didn’t offer suggestion. “¡Maldición!” She looked up. The sky was still sandy, hiding any hint of cloud, blue sky, and only the brightest part of the sky hinted at the sun’s location. She squinted, though the light was barely strong enough to cast a faint shadow. There wasn’t time to appreciate what little sunlight she was receiving. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo started back to Donner and Dawn. About halfway along the roof, she caught something on the ridge of the canyon wall. Though a half-mile from where Jo stood, it was clear that it was a woman, perched near the edge of the cliff, her white dress fluttering in the wind. “¿Cómo demonios…?” raised her hand and waved. After a moment, the woman raised her hand and waved slowly, looking as if her arm were caught in the same breeze as her clothing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo cupped her hands. “Hello!” she shouted. “Do you need help?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No, we’re good!” yelled the team over by Block 7. Jo snapped to their direction for a heartbeat, and then back to the woman. The woman was gone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo blinked and rubbed her eyes, then looked again. There was no sign of anyone on the rim, in any direction. “Necesito dormir más.” She walked over to Donner and Dawn. “Dawn, can you go check the teams and make sure they’re alright?” asked Jo. “It sounds like the folks over by 7 are fine, though,” she muttered. “I don’t know where one of the teams went, check over to Block 6?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Will do!” said Dawn, and headed off.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’ll come back up once the girder’s down!” Jo shouted after Dawn. Dawn raised her hand in acknowledgement, but didn’t turn around.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lugging the girder outside posed a different challenge than inside. Though they were able to walk along the chords of the roof, Jo worried silently at the extra weight they exerted on the roof, and kept Donner from moving too quickly. The beams underneath creaked and groaned, twice they had to stop and check the sand depth for safety. They rounded Block 7 carefully, and came over to the top of Block 9, where they slowly let the girder slide over the slope until it was out of sight. When the rope went slack, they let go of the rope.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Okay, it’s down. Let’s get that girder inside!” Jo said, looking up at the sky. The skies to the west seemed a shade darker. “¡Rápido!</p>



<p>“Er, how? Do we slide down?” asked Donner nervously.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Not unless you want to break every bone in your body. That turns into a steep drop-off pretty quickly. We’ll go down inside,” replied Jo, and headed along the back of the dome towards the stairs. She looked back up to the edge of the canyon wall. The woman hadn’t returned.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>From Block 1, Jo and Donner weaved their way all the way down to the dump door in Block 9. The room was filling with torn pieces of roof panels, hunks of metal that likely came out of Block 2, and several piles of sticks with small pieces of sandblasted wood. There was even three curvy sand-frosted glass bottles. Donner and Jo climbed down the ladder to the ground. They could see two groups of two walking back to the ladder, each person with their arms full of treasures to be assessed. They walked along the edge of Block 9 towards their girder. They reached a muddy slick that ran out a few feet before disappearing into the sand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What’s this?” asked Donner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We try to reuse whatever goes down the toilets, sometimes there’s overflow,” said Jo, hopping over it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Phew!” Donner waved his hand past his nose. “And I thought the toilets stank.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The sooner we get back in, the less we have to smell that,” said Jo, and continued to the girder.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The girder lay propped against the dome’s wall, more or less vertical from the ground. For a change, gravity worked in their favor: they got in behind the girder, and with a collective shove pushed it over, hitting the canyon floor with a rattling <em>CLANG!</em>. Several heads appeared like prairie dogs, startled by the sound. Without another word, Jo and Donner each took an end, and Jo led them back to the door in Block 9. Pulling it into the ARCH was another challenge, but it was mostly a straight run into the greenhouse and the reservoir wall. Then it was back to the roof as swiftly as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl waited at the base of the stairs to the roof. “I want my people back,” he said. Jo tried to ignore him as she headed to the stairs. He stepped in front of her. “Now. I’m taking them.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“¿Eres jodidamente estúpido?” Jo tried to shove Carl out of the way, but he clung to the railing. “Carl, they’re <em>fixing the roof</em>. Do you not understand what happens if the roof is not repaired?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They are not your people!” Carl yelled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They’re not <em>yours</em> either, Carl! They’re up there because they <em>volunteered</em> to go up there. Why are you the only one who doesn’t see value in keeping the roof over our heads?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I need those tunnels finished, then we can move on with the plan,” Carl growled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What plan is that?” asked Jo. “Staying alive? Not much of a plan.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’re so small-minded. You don’t see big pictures, never look at the long game. You just worry about your precious roof.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You never understood priorities. This is why you have Dawn to keep you in check, Carl. You couldn’t do it on your own.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl’s face was turning a deep red and Jo could spy his hand moving into a strike. It was interrupted by a shouting from the stairs leading to the roof, Carl and Jo looking up. Something about a rope, and ‘hurry’. Jo shoved the distracted Carl aside and took the stairs two at a time to the roof, Donner in close pursuit. An Apprentice was at the door way. “Who needs a rope?” Donner asked, holding it in his hand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Apprentice, an older man, pointed down towards the edge of Block 5. “Phyllis slipped into a sand trap.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As quickly as possible, the three of them moved down to Block 5. Another Apprentice, presumably the woman named Phyllis, was waist-deep in sand, trying not to move and failing at not panicking. Another Engineer, Jake, was perched at the edge. Donner handed Jake the rope, the end of which was carefully tossed to Phyllis. The four of them slowly dragged Phyllis from the sand trap and onto the roof.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How deep was it?” asked Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I didn’t touch bottom,” said Phyllis. She looked at Jake. “I… I slipped.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jake looked at Jo. “There’s a few of these along this side,” he pointed to another visible one where Blocks 5 and 8 overlapped with Block 4. “Some of these are really deep.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ugh,” Jo groaned. “That’s a lot of weight.”</p>



<p>“That might explain some of the shift,” offered Donner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo nodded. “We should have flattened that part out when we had the chance. If the winds don’t pick up again tomorrow, maybe we’ll get a few people out there to get the sand off. That might buy us a few more days.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If the winds stay quiet,” said Jake, looking at the blank beige sky. The last time, we got a few days. I can’t even remember the time before that.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>A voice called from back at the stairs. Jo turned to see Erik waving both of his hands. “¿Qué?” she yelled. “I can’t hear you!!” Erik yelled something again, but still went unheard. Jo looked at Donner. “You help them, okay? I’ll see what Erik wants.” She worked her way the length of a football field back to the doorway.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Your time is up,” said Erik as Jo approached. “Carl wants his people back.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah, he blocked me at the stairs. You know he nearly hit me?”</p>



<p>“He’s already taken the people from the canyon floor,” said Erik.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“¡¿Qué?!” Jo blurted. “They were finding materials! They had at least a hundred pounds of stuff we can smelt into—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I know,” said Erik calmly. “He took it all to Francis’s shop. He wants Dawn back, in particular.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What about the repairs, Erik? How the hell are we supposed to keep the roof up if we can’t actually <em>fix</em> it?!” Jo demanded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik held out both his hands to hold back Jo’s anger. “Relax, I’m on your side!” he said. “I’ll stall him as long as I can. I just don’t know how long that’ll be.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Gracias, Cariño. Maybe I can figure out how to bolt the door from this side,” Jo smiled slyly. She turned and started to head back to Dawn’s group as Erik headed down the stairs. She looked up at the canyon rim again. The woman was back. Jo stopped in her tracks and looked hard. At the distance, it was impossible to make out any details. Jo waved her hands above her head. The woman waved her hand as she had before, then pointed to the west. Jo followed the woman’s pointing, and saw a terribly dark, boiling cloud barreling towards them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo turned and shrieked: “EVERYONE INSIDE! <em>NOW!!!</em>”</p>



<p>Dawn’s team looked towards Jo, saw the cloud, and bolted. They sprinted across the chords and panels as if they were the sturdiest concrete. The other team, well away at the edge of Block 5, hadn’t so much as flinched. The turbines were moving faster, the blades blurring into translucent discs.</p>



<p>“INSIDE!! GET INSIDE!! STORM APPROACHING!!” Jo felt her vocal chords starting to blow out. The dusty wind held the odd speck of sand, which flicked off bare skin, a warning of things to come. One of the team looked up, hearing the echoes of Jo’s voice. Even at a distance, the dawning look of horror was clear, and the two scrambled up the edges and raced across the roof. The latecomers ducked low, fighting against the increasing force. Jo had backed towards the doorway,&nbsp; door’s inner handle. Dawn’s team reached the door first, all quickly passed inside, with Donner staying just beyond the entrance. Jo clung to the outside, beckoning the remaining two Engineers to hurry. A low hum began to vibrate through the roof, a harmonic from the wind over the surface. Not far away, a shrill overtone began to climb.</p>



<p>Jo looked back to Donner. “Where’s the rope?” she asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donner looked around. “Who has the rope?” He shouted down the stairs, then disappeared after the unheard response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“¡VAMOS! HURRY!” Jo shouted towards the two approaching people. They had only gotten as far as the edge of Block 3, and looked to be at a near standstill. The wind wasn’t strong enough to stop them, but the sand in the wind blinded them entirely. Not able to see where they were going, they slunk lower to the roof, walking in a line into the wind, their in front of their eyes, the front person feeling with his feet to ensure they were on the supports instead of the panels. “MOVE!” Jo screamed. One waved their hand desperately. “Where’s that rope?!” Jo called down the stairs. Suddenly the front person fell forward. The second let go of the first’s hands, springing to standing. “GET DOWN!” screamed Jo. “GET DOWN!!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>A gust of wind was all it took. The second person was blown over rolling onto their back. The wind rolled him down the curve of Block 4, across the plateau between Blocks 4, 5, and 6, and rolled around behind the edge of Block 8.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Got it!” Donner shouted over the wind, handing Jo the end of the rope they had used earlier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Tie it off!!” she shouted back. Donner quickly bound the end to the metal stair railing, as Jo lashed it around her waist. She was only a few steps beyond the door when her feet were swept out from under her, carrying her across the rooftop like the other man. She bounced several times before she finally landed, face down, on a panel and stopped. Her head rang with a hundred bells from the impacts. She squinted against the sand in the wind to spy the person who’d gone prone against the roof. He was barely ten feet away. Slowly, Jo turned herself around, and pulled herself across the surface until she was next to him. She linked her arm into his, and then tugged on the rope. She felt it start to pull, and she started to pull on it, and the man. The two of them inched their way towards the door, the sand tearing at their exposed skin. They kept their eyes closed, their eyelids being scratched. Getting back to the doorway, Dawn pulled the man inside as Donner pulled in Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’ve got to go for Henry!” the man moaned over the increasing wind. “He’s still out there!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo wiped away bloody tears from her eyes and looked out the doorway. The sand was so thick that they could barely see a dozen feet beyond. The top of Block 4 was gone, and anything beyond was no more than a memory. Jo sat heavily. “Someone get the suit!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Is Henry in the same place?” asked Dawn.</p>



<p>“No,” Jo choked. “He got blown over. He’s … somewhere. Hopefully on Block 8!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Block 8?! Forget it, Jo! Even if the suit protected you enough for this, an unprotected person wouldn’t survive! Besides, this rope isn’t long enough. I don’t think we have enough rope for you to go that far!” Dawn said, barely audible in the stairway. “He’s lost.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No!” the man shouted, grabbing Jo by her bloodied shirt. “We can’t leave him out there! He’ll <em>die!</em>”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“He’s dead already,” said Dawn, pulling the man off of Jo. “And if it wasn’t for Jo, you’d be dead, too.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’ve killed him,” the man said, collapsing. “You sent us out there to die.” He looked at Jo. “Y’know, we only hear the banshee when someone’s going to die.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Get to the infirmary!” Dawn pushed the man towards the stairs. Jo continued to look out the door, feeling the sand starting to fall on her hair and in her eyes. Donner and Dawn pulled the door shut and started to bolt it closed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Are you okay?” Dawn asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No,” Jo said quietly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It wasn’t your fault, Jo,” said Dawn. “We all know that the weather can change without warning. We thought we’d have time.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Who’s the ‘Banshee’?” Donner asked almost quietly enough not to be heard.</p>



<p>Jo looked at him, wiping tears from her eyes. She moved to speak, then retreated. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Banshees are Irish ghosts,” said Dawn. “They wail when someone is about to die.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo spoke up before Donner could ask another question. “My Mother’s side was Latino, mostly Mexican. My Dad’s side was Irish.” She wiped another tear, cringing slightly from the sting of open cuts. “When the winds started to cause vibrations and echoes in the ARCH, we were only worried about things coming lose. One day, it shrieked like nothing we’d ever heard before, and I joked that it sounded like the banshee stories my grandmother used to tell me.” Jo sighed and sobbed.</p>



<p>“The next day, we found out that someone had died. The name stuck,” said Dawn. “Every time the banshee screams, someone dies.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">“Professor, we have a problem!” Carl announced, trotting into his office.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Batesworth looked away from the schematics on his walls. “What is now, Carl?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Jo’s killed an Engineer!”</p>



<p>Batesworth slumped slightly. “What? How?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“She took a bunch of people on the roof—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I know, she was down here a few hours ago looking for volunteers. You took back the ones on the canyon floor not too long ago. The rest were on the roof making repairs.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The wind came up,” Carl said. The corner of his mouth curled. “She threw one of them to his death.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“‘Threw’?” Batesworth’s eyebrow crested like a wave. “Jo’s not one to throw people, even at her worst.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“She left him to die.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That’s different than ‘throw’, Carl,” said Batesworth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’re missing the point, Professor!” Carl pressed. “Someone’s dead and it’s Jo’s fault!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I understand your concern, Carl, but I need more details. What <em>exactly</em> happened?” Batesworth stood and scanned Carl’s face.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The group was on the roof, the wind picked up, and Jo left one behind. <em>Intentionally</em>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“She knowingly left someone out there in the windstorm?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yes.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“And you were there to witness this, yourself, with your own eyes?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl hesitated. “No, I was back in the tunnels when—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“And you know what happened, how?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Dawn told me,” said Carl. “She was there. She saw the whole thing. She can vouch for everything I’ve just told you!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Anyone else see this?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl chewed a moment. “There’s that guy that’s been hanging around with her, her assistant,” he said grudgingly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Batesworth nodded. “Do you know the name of the deceased?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I thought you knew the names of all the Engineers, Carl.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“He was … an Apprentice, I think.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That’s an important detail, hmm?” Batesworth returned to his chair. “Jo led a team to the roof, which included her assistant, Dawn, and some Apprentices. The wind picked up, and Jo <em>intentionally</em> left someone outside. That’s your statement?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl nodded. “Yes. Intentionally killed someone.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How is it that you’re always the one to come in here and tell me that the Engineers are committing horrible acts, Carl?” Batesworth took a deep breath and let it slowly back out. “Where is Jo now?”</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>The lowest point of the ARCH was on the downward slope of the canyon floor, a crawlspace under Block 9’s bottom floor as it spanned over boulders. The outside wind caused just enough of a draft through the multitude of gaps to keep the dark void dusty. A lone figure lay in a well-used patch, curled up in the dimness, her back turned against the small world behind. The wind was little more than a low moaning, the high-velocity winds affecting only the older, upper options of the structure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite all efforts to the contrary, the figure would not be left alone long.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Jo,” called a voice near the void’s mouth. “Come out. Talk to me.” With an apparent lack of response or motion, Erik sat down on the ground and peered in. “I know you’re in there. As much as you think you can hide away, you can’t. I know your places, even this one.” He waited a few moments for any kind of acknowledgement. “I can’t say I know what you’re going through. I don’t. I’ve not done what you’ve done — wait, sorry, that wasn’t… I don’t know how to do what you do, how you see things and their effects. You saw the problems before anyone else, you’re the only one who spoke up about them. You saw the value of the wind having died down before any of us were … were willing to do anything about it.” Erik looked for movement. “Going outside is risky, too many of us are terrified of what could happen that we never think about alternative.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Carl did,” said Jo, her response muted and echoey. “He thinks I’m too stupid to think of the risks.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah, he mentioned something like that to me,” Erik nodded. “You know what I told him?” Erik waited for a response that didn’t come. “I told him that you’re the only one brave enough to go outside. The only one smart enough to know the risks of going outside. People followed you because they trust you, Jo. They know what you’re capable of. It doesn’t matter what Carl thinks or says. He’s so afraid of you that his mouth speaks before his brain thinks and he just looks worse every time. You did what needed to be done, the only one courageous enough to open the door and step outside.” He stopped looking into the void, brought his knees to his chin and stared off across the space. “People trust you, follow you. That’s way more than … well, pretty much more than the rest of us can say. People listen to us, but they don’t believe us, not me or Rich or Carl or Bonnie or Francis. When you speak, they believe you.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo appeared at Erik’s side. “Do you believe me?”</p>



<p>Erik smiled. “Always.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Slowly, Jo reached out and touched Erik on the shoulder. “Gracias, cariño.Yo necesitaba eso.” She sidled up next to him like cat. “Te necesito.” Hesitantly, Erik moved his arm around her. She pulled his arm all the way around her, encouraging a tight hold. “Te amo,” she whispered.&nbsp;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>“Have a seat,” said Batesworth, tapping a chair he had brought into his cramped office. Jo, her arms wrapped around herself tightly, looked at Batesworth, then the chair. She looked back towards Erik, who stood out of Batesworth’s view. “I just want to talk, Jo. We have to talk.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo tentatively stepped into the room and slowly sat on the front part of the seat, her arms still in place. She looked at a random diagram on the wall, not registering anything else about it. “I killed someone,” she said softly. “I killed Henry.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Batesworth leaned forward, resting his elbows on his chair. “I’ve heard. I don’t suppose you want to talk about what happened?” Jo fiercely shook her head. “We can’t ignore this, Jo. It’s happened. As much as you might want to forget it, you can’t change what was done.” He leaned back to sit upright. “I won’t ask if you think you’re responsible. You take responsibility far more seriously than most.” He looked at Jo’s unmoving expression, her eyes locked on a point many yards past the picture on the wall. “This isn’t something we can’t sweep away, even if it was one of us. You know that, right?” Jo nodded slightly. “We will have to convene a tribunal.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo stiffened. “I … they … if I’m convicted … you’ll banish me.” Tears erupted and rolled down her cheek.</p>



<p>Batesworth watch the drops seep down her skin, falling loose from her chin, onto the floor with a light <em>pit</em> sound, forming a tiny mud puddle from the dust. “It’s a possibility,” he nodded. “If you are convicted, the Council has the right to pass judgement, which includes the potential for banishment. But I don’t think the Council will—“</p>



<p>“Carl hates me,” said Jo. “He banished Robert. He hated Robert, too. Frank will say what Carl says.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Carl is opinionated, no less than you. You fought for Robert’s clemency, as I recall, very vehemently.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo faced Batesworth. “I’m on trial, Rich. I don’t get a say.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Batesworth leaned forward again, nodding. “True. That is true. In fact, we’ll probably have a stalemate. We’ll have to include another person for quorum.”</p>



<p>“Dawn,” said Jo.</p>



<p>“Perhaps,” said Batesworth. “Francis might have a few words to say about that.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When?” said Jo.</p>



<p>“Francis? Well, I haven’t talked to him yet—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The trial.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Oh. Not at least for a day or two. We’ll have to prepare, talk to witnesses, you know the process. I have to find Agatha and make sure she’s still willing to participate.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Jail.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Jail?” Batesworth asked. “You?” He shook his head. “Jail … locking you up in a room doesn’t help anyone right now. You’re not on a murderous spree, you do not pose a risk.” He scratched at his chin. “If anything, I would say putting you <em>in</em> jail is a risk to all of us. As I recall, you’re working on that reinforcement in the greenhouse.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo nodded slowly.</p>



<p>“How much work is left?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I … I’m not sure,” said Jo. “We … um, we have mould blocks. We, uh, have to carve them… then the workshop can cast. If that goes well, maybe … three days? I think?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Erik!” Batesworth called. Erik appeared at the doorway. “We will be conducting a tribunal to investigate the death of Apprentice Henry … last name?” Batesworth looked at both Erik and Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Sorry, I didn’t even know his first name,” Erik said. Jo shook her head.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We will ensure to get that detail,” said Batesworth. “In the meantime, Ms. De Leon is on suspension until the tribunal. If anyone asks, she is being isolated from the population.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“And in reality?” Erik asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Saving the ARCH.”&nbsp;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>“I’m going to die,” shuddered Jo. “Carl will make sure of it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Carl can stuff it,” said Erik. The two of them walked down the hallway towards the stairs that would take them to the greenhouse. “Carl thinks he’s the King of the ARCH and his rule is law. I wouldn’t worry about him. Besides, the tribunal won’t convict you.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How do you know?” asked Jo through a sob. “Carl will make sure Rich only hears lies. Agatha doesn’t even like me.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“She doesn’t like any of the Engineers,” said Erik. “But she knows what we do is important.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“She doesn’t like me,” Jo repeated. “Two to one.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’re assum—,” Erik cut himself off. “Sorry, I … this isn’t the right time to be cute.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo stopped. “Siempre eres lindo,” she said through a thin smile. “It’s okay. I might have laughed at it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No, you wouldn’t have,” said Erik. They arrived at the door and he let her go down first. They descended the stairs slowly, Jo taking each step with a confident suspicion. They said nothing until they reached the bottom.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ellas me van a rechazar,” Jo said, looking at the gardeners.</p>



<p>“Huh?”</p>



<p>“They know,” said Jo. “They’ll hate me.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Why would that do that?” asked Erik. “You’re about the only person in this place who recognizes them. You know their names, where they came from.” As if in response, Jo’s name burst from within the plants. Heads popped up immediately behind the verge.&nbsp; whose arms were caked in dirt. Over a dozen leaped up, frantically rubbing the dirt from their hands and arms, and ran across the floor to Jo, all crying various things that Erik couldn’t understand. As they approached, Jo cringed defensively. “You know their life stories, Jo,” he said to her ear. “You’re a part of their family.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anita was the first to arrive. “¡Que el amor de Dios te proteja, Jo!” She wrapped herself around Jo and held her tightly. “Lo que necesites, solo tienes que preguntar.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>One by one, all of the gardeners held Jo and spoke. Erik stepped away as the crowd grew too large for him to remain near. With each person, Jo slumped a little less, smiled a little more. When the last had offered condolences and love, Jo looked at each of them, her face wet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Gracis, todos. Sin ustedes, soy nada,” said Jo. Her smile wavered and cracked, her face folded, and her strength fled. Jo fell to her knees and burst out in a wail that echoed throughout the cavernous space. “Soy nada!” she continued, as her friends gathered, surrounding her completely.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donner approached Erik. “Is she … okay?”</p>



<p>“No.” Erik held his arms around himself. “I don’t know if any of us will be.” &nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Jo stared at the dark orange shape, neither able to truly recognize what it was or what it should look like. She picked it up slowly, turning it over carefully as if too sudden a movement might cause it to explode.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What do you think?” asked Donner. They were sitting against the reservoir, the commotion of the previous hour having died away and activities returning largely to normal. “Does it look okay?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Where… where does this go?” Jo asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That’s the support mount,” said Donner. “It would go up there,” he pointed about ten feet off the ground at a point marked with a piece of chalk. “I carved it so it would fit the eye of the girder,” he pointed to the girder lying on the ground. “The one we got from Block 3 will fit perfect.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How…” Jo held out the block and tried to visualize it being in place with the girder coming out towards the reservoir wall. “How did you get the angle?” The shackle on the mount was not orthogonal to the plate, and tilted to the side.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Rope,” said Donner. “I tied it off at the mark, and brought it down to the shackle on the wall.” He pointed to the dull grey metal shackle on the wall, held in place with a pair of metal rods poking out of the holes. “Phil brought it down this morning while we were on the … while we were … um …”</p>



<p>“We were on the roof,” Jo finished.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Sorry,” Donner mumbled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Don’t be,” said Jo. “You had nothing to do with … that.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I was there,” said Donner. “I saw what happened.” He reached out and tapped Jo’s knee. “And I’m here. I can’t be like them,” he waved towards the gardeners, “I can’t speak Spanish, and I’m definitely not as good at this stuff as you are, but I want to help.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>A small smile returned Donner’s words. “Thanks, Donner.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Hey, what are assistants for, right?” he smiled back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’re a friend,” said Jo. “And they’re in short supply right now.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>They smiled at one another for a moment, then each picked up a cube of orange wax. Silently, they started to work on the next set of molds that were needed for the second girder. Their knives, stubby and thin from too many sharpenings, whittled away at the blocks, slowly revealing the shapes that would eventually be cast in metal. Flick by flick, little bits of orange filled the ground in front of them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The field of orange in front of Jo was more bare than Donner’s. Her knife moved with less certainty, less need, removing small flecks; Donner produced pieces easily the size of his finger with every swipe. Jo looked absently at her block of wax, the knife tracing and retracing the shape to be, the shape locked inside, begging to be freed, its carver unaware her actions were fruitless.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A twist of the blade plunged the knife down, burying it so it couldn’t move forward. Jo humphed and tried to move it again. She struggled and pushed, swearing under her breath. The knife buried up to its handle was stuck. Jo pulled hard at the handle, the knife initially refusing to budge, somehow sensing the next moments. Unable to stop, Jo tugged and wiggled and grunted and pushed and kicked the knife free. She changed her grip, the blade moving from being out of her&nbsp; hand by the thumb, to protruding from her fist near her pinky finger. She plunged the knife into the block with a frustrated scream. She pulled the knife out, and repeated. Again and again, she stabbed at the block, the dark orange turning a lighter hue with each gouge, Jo’s voice becoming a shredded howl echoing in the greenhouse.</p>



<p>Donner caught her hand before she plunged the knife again. Jo didn’t resist as he carefully pried the knife from her hand and tossed it away. Her voice contracted and sucked inward into a wail, then to a soft sobbing. Donner gingerly lowered Jo’s arm, pushed the wax block away, and wrapped his arms around Jo.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>“This looks like shit,” said Jo, holding the shape in her hand. It had taken Donner and Jo several hours to carve Jo’s block into the shackle that was needed. Whereas Donner’s mounting bracket — a far similar shape — was smooth, Jo’s was haggard with remnants of her stabbing fit.</p>



<p>“Once it melts, the outside shape will hold, right?” said Donner. “These little marks won’t show up.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Still looks like shit.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So long as it holds, that’s all we need, Jo,” Donner asked assuredly.</p>



<p>Jo looked at Donner. “Thanks. Really. I, uh, I couldn’t have done this without you Donner. Any of this.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What’re friends for?” Donner said, not really a question. “Let’s go get these cast. The sooner we have real parts, the sooner we can get these put in.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’re starting to sound like me,” Jo said as they started towards the stairs. “I wish I sounded like me.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You will,” said Donner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Up the stairs and down the hallways and into the Atrium they went, creeping around the various sleeping figures while the roof rattled far above, sand falling and drifting in the still air. The workshop door was closed, as usual, and Donner pounded for attention. The slot slid open and Donner held up the blocks.</p>



<p>“We need these cast!” he said proudly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Who are you?” asked the eyes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donner stepped back to reveal Jo. “I’m with Jo.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The eyes glared. “Come to throw us off the roof, too?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That’s not funny,” said Donner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“She killed a guy,” the eyes accused.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Someone died in the wind,” said Donner soberly. He looked the eyes carefully. “Did you know him?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How many people have died here?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How many people have died in the ARCH?” asked Donner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I don’t—“</p>



<p>“And you don’t know most of them,” said Donner. “How many have died in the tunnels?” Donner stepped right to the eyes, looking squarely at them. “Do you know any of them? Does the guy running the tunnels catch shit for it?” The slot slammed shut.</p>



<p>“Donner, I’m not sure—,“ said Jo.</p>



<p>“It’s not fair that they pick on you when so many others are hurt and killed in the tunnels. They’ve singled you out!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo nodded. “Sí.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The workshop door opened. Donner looked at Jo, then both went through. Phil waited for them on the other side.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Hey Jo,” said Phil quietly. “The, uh, guys are…”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Being assholes!” Donner shouted. “It was an accident!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Donner, don’t,” Jo cautioned. “Phil, we need these cast. Rapido. Can you get these in?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I dunno,” Phil said, glancing over his shoulder towards the roaring smelter. “They’re finishing up a pour. I think we can get these to you in a few hours. That good enough?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo nodded. “Yeah.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You okay, Jo?” asked Phil. Jo looked at Phil with a blank expression. “Was it an accident?” Jo didn’t react.</p>



<p>“It was,” said Donner. “I saw it all. She tried to save him. Jo wanted to go back out and bring him back. But the wind was too strong and there was no safety suit.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phil glanced around him and leaned in towards Jo. “I’m sorry, Jo. Carl came in here, and … well, you know. I believe what he,” Phil nodded towards Donner, “said. I believe you tried. I’ll … I’ll see if I can get the guys here to believe, too.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo wiped away a tear and nodded. “Gracias, Phil.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“C’mon, Jo,” said Donner, pulling gently on her arm. “You need to get some rest.”&nbsp;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Jo slept in the greenhouse, tucked around the side of the reservoir. The fitful sleep was interrupted multiple times by her own sudden shrieks and cries, bolting upright to realize her whereabouts, then coaxed back to sleep by Donner, who barely slept himself. Donner retrieved the heavy metal mounts from the workshop, one at a time, lugging them slowly through the atrium, down the hallways and (very carefully) down the stairs. The sound of the second, heavier one, woke Jo from her light slumber.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo came around the corner of the reservoir to find Donner crumpled against the wall, heaving. His hands, despite wearing some borrowed heavy gloves, were bloodied from the rough edges of the shackle having torn into his flesh.</p>



<p>“Díos mio!” Jo cried and went to him. “Are you okay?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Me? Yeah,” Donner said panting. “These things are heavy.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Your hands!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah, the edges are a bit rough.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Es mi culpa.”</p>



<p>“I’ll live,” said Donner. “Give me a minute and we can get this first one in place.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Bueno.”</p>



<p>With the gloves doubled over, she dragged the shackle to its point on the wall, and the mounting bracket to its strut. Throwing a rope though a strut nearly twenty feet up, she tied the mounting bracket and pulled it up to its approximate height up the strut and tied it off. By the time she was finished, Donner was lifting the shackle up the wall to align with the holes. It took both of them, with significant grunting and more than a few curses in two languages to fit the first rock bolt into a corner, dangling the shackle by its corner.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>“I assume we need this?” Donner produced a long pole with a goosenecked socket. Jo nodded and Donner fitted the socket over the end of the rock bolt. Initially just twisting the pole, the gooseneck attachment became more prominent as the bolt tightened into the hole, the pole swaying out to the sides with every rotation, until half-turns were the only possibility, the both of them pulling hard on each twist. They left the bolt with a quarter inch of space remaining.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“One down, five to go,” said Donner, picking up another bolt. They slid the shackle along the way, pivoting on the one bolt, and tapped another bolt into the opposite corner. The pole was attached, and the twisting ballet resumed. One by one, all six bolts were put in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Why didn’t we,” Donner panted while Jo downed a large bottle of water, “tighten them?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Binding,” Jo burped. “If we’d tightened too soon, the bolts might have pulled the shackle too much and the other bolts wouldn’t get in properly.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Oh,” Donner nodded. “I think I get it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Oh, you’ll get it the first time you bind something and have to undo all the bolts to fix it.”</p>



<p>Following a zig-zag pattern, Donner and Jo tightened each bolt until it was flush with the shackle, and the shackle was pulled as tightly into the wall as possible. Jo climbed up on top of it and gave a good jump, not so much as causing a speck of dust to fall. “Que hará.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Now the strut?” asked Donner, looking up at the dangling bracket.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Sí,” said Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“And how do we get up there?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ladder.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donner looked at Jo. “Not ‘ladders’?” he asked, stressing the plurality.</p>



<p>“Ladder,” Jo reiterated. “We’ve got one that’ll reach. I’ll go get it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ladder, a foldable model acquired years earlier while scavenging through nearly-abandoned towns, had seen much abuse. Unfolded, its top came to just above the point at which the bracket would wrap around the strut.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It says load limit of 250 pounds,” said Donner, reading what was left of a label stuck inside one of the legs. He looked at the erected ladder with trepidation. “You want both of us to go up there?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We need three hands at least,” said Jo, tucking a wrench in one pocket, and bolts in the other. “I can’t weigh more than a hundred.” She glanced over Donner, who despite his height was much skinnier. “I’d give you maybe the same.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, but this ladder is beat up.”</p>



<p>“Well, if you’d stop eating all those donuts, we wouldn’t have a problem,” smirked Jo.</p>



<p>“God, I miss donuts.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo went up the ladder first and secured the top with the end of the rope that also held the bracket in the air, simultaneously adjusting the bracket’s position so that it aligned exactly with where it needed to be. She then wrapped the rest of the rope around her waist and swung around the strut so that she straddled the strut, her feet on the third rung down from the top. “¡Vamos!” she called to Donner, waving him up. Donner checked the large rocks at the base of the ladder, holding the feet in place, then slowly crawled his way to the top.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With his weight on the ladder, Donner was the lucky one who got to hold up the rear of the bracket so that Jo could push through the bolts with one hand — the other holding herself onto the strut — until the back was held enough in place for Donner to use a hand to turn on the nuts. With the bracket held just enough in place, Donner blissfully descended the ladder again to hold the base, while Jo swung back around to the ladder side again. With a slight tap of the hammer to move the bracket back down to match the mark on the strut, Jo tightened the bolts, then descended back down, the rope still tied around her waist.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Girder?” Donner asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Girder,” said Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How do we get this thing in place?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’ll lift up the top with the rope—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Is it strong enough?” Donner asked, looking at the dingy, frayed twists.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Let’s hope so,” said Jo. “Once the top is up, we’ll attach the bottom,” she pointed to the shackle in the wall, “then attach the top.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This would be so much easier with more people,” Donner commented.</p>



<p>“Then we get to do it all over again!” Jo smiled dryly, pointing at the opposite end of the reservoir, which sat waiting for the next bout of work to begin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donner slumped. “Not funny.”</p>



<p>“Wasn’t meant to be,” said Jo, tying off the end of the girder around the outside of the eye. “C’mon…”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The rope whizzed and wheezed as Jo and Donner used their collective weight to pull the girder from the ground. Eventually reaching a point above the mounting bracket on the strut, they tied the rope off, then lifted the other end of the girder on top of the shackle mounted on the reservoir wall. They wiggled the eye of the girder repeatedly, but it steadfastly refused to fall into the slot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Mierda,” muttered Jo.</p>



<p>“I think I goofed on the measurements,” said Donner. “That ruler is weird.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I don’t think it was the ruler,” said Jo. “We calculated for contraction. But something’s odd with this alloy.” She crouched down and looked closely at the shackle. She scratched at the surface. “Phil mention anything about what this is made of?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Um, no, he didn’t say. Why?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This doesn’t look like steel,” she said, taking a wrench and scratching heavily. The dull outside gave way to a shinier interior. “Malditos. Did those morons dump bronze in there?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Bronze?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There’s a yellowy metal mixed in. A little bit, but it didn’t mix properly.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So&#8230;?”</p>



<p>“You ever bake a cake?” asked Jo.</p>



<p>“Yeah, long time ago,” said Donner. “I miss cake, too.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You ever mix it so badly that you saw chunks of flour?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No, but my brother did that with pancakes once. Grossest pancakes I ever ate.” Donner stuck out his tongue to the memory.</p>



<p>“Same thing happens in metals. You don’t mix it right, you can have structural issues.” She scraped at another section. The same flecks appeared. “I really hope it’s only at the outsides.” She looked up at the strut. “We don’t have time for them to do it again.” She shook her head. “Espero que esto funcione.” She walked over to a large metal mallet sitting on the ground and heaved it up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What’s that for?” asked Donner.</p>



<p>She pointed the mallet at the girder. “One way or another, that’s going in. Hold it in place, will you?” Donner held the girder such that the eye was aligned with the slot. Jo wound up and drove the mallet’s head onto the edge of the two inch-thick eye. Barely budging, it rang loudly, causing several of the gardeners to jump in surprise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“¡Disculpame!” Jo called back sheepishly. “Esto será ruidoso.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo wound up again and drove the mallet back down, with similar results. After three more swings, she held the mallet out to Donner. They switched places, and he swung four times. On the fourth hit, Jo could see that the edge of the eye had peeled against the shackle slightly, enough that the eye had dipped about an eighth of an inch into the slot. Nodding, she reached out for the mallet and they swapped places. Swing, <em>bong</em>. Swing, <em>bong</em>. Swing, <em>bong</em>. Switch. Swing, <em>bong</em>. Swing, <em>bong</em>. Swing, <em>bong</em>. Swing, <em>bong</em>. Switch. Slowly, the <em>bong</em> reverberated less and became more of a <em>bonk</em>, and the eye slipped more and more into the slot. About two-thirds of the way in, however, the eye became irretrievably stuck and refused to move any further.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What do we do?” asked Donner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No se.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Don’t say what?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“¡NO SE!” Jo shouted. “IT MEANS ‘I DON’T KNOW’!” Donner cringed. Jo cringed as well and shook her head. “I’m… sorry, Donner. I’m so sorry. I’m…”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I know,” Donner said quietly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No,” said Jo. “You don’t know. That’s not your fault. It’s mine. I’m … I’m tired. I’m <em>exhausted</em>. I’m a murderer.” Donner moved to speak and Jo immediately threw out her hand. “Don’t. It’s what happened. I’m wrong. I’ve made a mistake.” She looked at the eye-shackle union. “Two mistakes. And I can’t … I just can’t. I can’t do this anymore. This place is beating me.” She whacked the eye with the mallet. “It keeps beating me.” She whacked it again. “It thinks it can get the <em>better</em>—,“ she slammed the mallet into the eye, “—of me! It does it again—,” <em>whack</em>, “—<em>again—,</em>” <em>whack</em>, “—<em>again</em>—,” <em>wham</em>, “—<em>y otra vez, su maltida</em>—,” <em>WHAM</em>, “—<em>PINCHE</em>—“, <em>WHAM</em>, “—<em>HIJO DE PUTA</em>!” She drove a furious slap into the eye, and the girder suddenly shifted an entire inch, nearly fitting exactly where it needed to be. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Huh,” said Donner. “At least it’ll be a tight fit.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Jo lay on her cot, staring at the cracked paint on her ceiling, her mind turned cinema replaying the same scene. A light shrill undulated over the howling wind, an echo of a death. Someone had died because of her. She knew his name: Henry. Like countless others in the ARCH, Jo knew nothing about him, if he had any family, where he had come from, or even where he’d worked. So many had come to the ARCH to be saved. So many banshees, so many dead. Young and old, strong and feeble, healthy and sick, the banshee had never discriminated and took randomly. Henry was another name on a memorial that would never be built. &nbsp;</p>



<p>A loud bell, a pair of girders welded together in a crude tuning fork, suspended from the roof in the middle of the atrium, rang dissonantly against the wind’s chorus. The shift bell rang every eight hours, in one, two, or three tones, indicating the shift number. Jo rose as did several in the room beyond, pulled on her pants and shirt, trudged down the hallway with others to pass through the toilet on the way to the dining hall. As she turned the corner and saw the lineup, she was unable to bring herself to get anything to eat, her empty stomach steadfastly warning her that food was not welcome. As others flowed around her, Jo stared into the distance. Jo was about to face her first tribunal.</p>



<p>As a member of the Council, Jo had participated in a few tribunals, taking the role of Lead Engineer when Erik was unwilling. She had heard the arguments, seen the evidence, considered the impacts, passed judgement. The first time had been deep nerves and near panic, the worry about false accusation and condemning the innocent. The second time, experience took root and helped her through the debates. By the fourth trial, the cold calculation of pro and con had regulated every question and response, and things seemed so much easier. There was no doubt the same methodical logic awaited as she approached the Council room.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Batesworth was already present, as was Erik. They nodded as Jo entered, Batesworth wordlessly indicating the seat Jo was to take. There were four seats, each spaced equidistant from the others. Batesworth and Erik remained standing for several more moments, until an older woman, a little wrinkled with some white in her otherwise black hair entered the room. Jo nodded at Agatha Reyes, the elected representative of the ARCH whom she’d met on previous trials. Reyes bore the scratches of scars of someone who had spent a lot of time in the tunnels, including a slightly limp from a rockfall. Reyes took the fourth chair; Batesworth and Erik then sat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This tribunal comes to order,” announced Batesworth. “I, Richard Batesworth, Leader of the ARCH—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’ve asked you to stop using that,” said Reyes. “It’s the worst form of classism.”</p>



<p>“Ms. Reyes,” Batesworth sighed, “we represent the three parts of the ARCH—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There is no one Leader,” Reyes said. “There is the People, and there are the Engineers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yes, and in a proper governance, there is a titular leader to—“</p>



<p>“What, lord over us?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even ensconced in her cloud of doom, Jo rubbed her face to fight off a rising smirk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Could we go with Elected, Engineer, and Founder?” Erik asked. “We did that last time.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“And as I have said—“ Batesworth caught the glare from Reyes. “—we will need this properly documented at a different time,” he muttered. “Joanna de Leon, you have been accused of gross negligence that lead to the death of Engineer Apprentice Henry Pelton. Before we begin with this assessment, do you disagree with this accusation?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No,” Jo said quietly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Very well,” said Batesworth. “Each of us have conducted interviews with the people who were present on the roof at the time, and we have taken these insights into account.” Batesworth turned to Reyes. “I call upon Ms. Reyes for the popular opinion.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>‘Popular’,</em>” Reyes snorted. “I talked with ten people, all of whom confirmed that Ms. de Leon had interrupted an impromptu Engineer meeting two days ago, and ordered twenty people outside. Eight of them went to the roof. The rest went out onto the valley floor. Both the crews on the roof and valley floor were unsupervised. Several saw Ms. De Leon distracted by something on the hill several times, not paying attention to the crews and their work. And she did not track the weather closely enough, leading to Mr. Pelton’s death. It is my opinion that, as an acting supervisor, Ms. de Leon was responsible for everyone’s actions and should have stayed on the roof and kept close watch on the conditions. Though I’m sure whatever it was that she went off to do was important, it could not have been more important than people’s lives. And when one of them was swept away due to her negligence, she chose to let a man die, rather than try to save him. It is the <em>popular</em>,” she glared at Batesworth for emphasis, “opinion that Ms. de Leon doesn’t have the ability to lead. We believe she should be stripped of her privileges and put into the general population.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Thank you, Ms. Reyes,” said Batesworth through his teeth. “Mr. Larsen, what is the Engineer opinion?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik looked at Batesworth, then at Reyes, before turning to Jo. Upon meeting her eyes, he stiffened and reddened, his mouth opened and closed without sound. Jo mouthed “it’s okay” to him. He nodded. “As you may recall, Professor Batesworth, that morning was chaotic. There were nearly forty people in the office, which made it impossible to hear or be heard. You and I were attempting to figure out work assignments with everyone arguing their priorities, when Ms. de Leon arrived and shouted us all down. I believe that is the interruption that Ms. Reyes referred to?” Reyes nodded. “Ms. de Leon then asked for five volunteers to come with her to the roof, and said we needed another ten to scrounge the canyon floor for anything we could use. Neither you nor I objected.” Batesworth nodded. “For whatever reason, Ms. De Leon’s actions got twenty-one volunteers, of which nine went to the roof. The remainder were sent to the canyon and told to bring back anything remotely useful. Given the conditions at the time, no-one thought to ask for any other instructions. Ms. De Leon went to the roof gave the volunteers clear instructions on how to walk safely, and stay away from sand traps. With them was Dawn Porter, an Engineer, who had experience with roof repairs and oversaw much of the activity there.” Erik took a deep breath before continuing, taking a quick glance at Reyes. “Ms. de Leon’s ulterior motive was to obtain a girder, which she was planning to use to brace the main struts under Block 4, which are showing serious deviation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reyes’ eyes shot open. “What?!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ms. Reyes,” said Batesworth calmly, “you will remember that this is a closed session, and anything you learn here must be kept secret.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That sounds like the ARCH is collapsing!!” Reyes shouted at Batesworth, who didn’t react. “Is it?!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It is moving,” said Erik. “Ms. De Leon recognized the problem and is working to prevent further slippage.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How <em>dare</em> you keep that from us!” shouted Reyes.</p>



<p>“<em>Agatha!</em>” snapped Batesworth. Reyes’ eyes burned in response. “There are plans to keep everyone safe. That is why the Engineers <em>exist</em>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You should have told us,” Reyes growled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Batesworth signed annoyedly. “To what end? Would that improve our situation at all? What we would have is mass panic. <em>That</em> is why you weren’t told.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Your classist distrust of us is sickening.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Batesworth ignored the insult. “Erik, please continue.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik nodded. “Jo— <em>Ms. de Leon</em> was moving girders to secure the struts and minimize further shifting. This is why Dawn Porter was charge. In addition to Ms. Porter, there were two other people with prior roof experience. Ms. de Leon and her assistant, Donner Vasquez, were working for roughly two hours to open a hole in the roof, move out the girder, close the hole, transfer the girder to the east side of the ARCH, and then move the girder to its current resting place under Block 4. They returned to the roof immediately afterwards. At that time, there was a near-accident on the roof, where volunteer Phyllis Bell slipped and fell into a sand pit. Ms. De Leon and her assistant were instrumental in helping Ms. Bell out of the pit, who was unharmed. I am told that Ms. Porter looked regularly for the weather conditions, which were calm and stable. I arrived on the roof about that time to inform Ms. de Leon that the people she’d taken to do repairs were being ordered to return to their scheduled shift work. She expressed her concern that she needed more time. I indicated that until Engineer Carl Young had finished discussions with you, Professor,” Erik nodded towards Batesworth, “she could continue to work. I then left. The wind started about two minutes later, by the time I had entered the atrium.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“And this is when Mr. Pelton died?” asked Batesworth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yes,” Reyes and Erik both replied.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“He was swept away in the wind,” said Reyes.</p>



<p>“Did Ms. de Leon make any effort to warn anyone?” asked Batesworth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As I understand, yes, she did,” said Erik. “She saw the storm approaching and called for everyone to get off the roof. Most of the people were fairly close to the door, and got inside before the wind picked up. However, Mr. Pelton and his partner, José Yerbin, were around the back of Block 8. It’s nearly a thousand yards back to the door.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“She let them get too far away from safety. They should have been secured with ropes,” said Reyes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They got within fifty yards of the door before the wind got too strong,” Erik continued. “Ms. de Leon ordered them to lay down. This is how Mr. Yerbin survived. However, Mr. Pelton did not lay down quickly enough and was blown off his feet. He rolled out of sight, several hundred yards away. Ms. de Leon tied a rope around herself and went out to retrieve Mr. Yerbin. Both of them sustained severe scrapes from the blowing sand. By the time Mr. Yerbin was safe, however, the sand was blowing so hard that it would have been fatal for anyone to go back out without protection.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“She performs repairs on the roof, doesn’t she?” Reyes demanded. “Why didn’t she retrieve the suit, and then go out after Mr. Pelton?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“An excellent question,” said Batesworth. “Is there anything else, Mr. Larsen?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In discussions with Francis Porter, the workshop manager, Ms. de Leon’s actions resulted in the acquisition of several hundred pounds of materials we can reuse for maintenance. Dawn Porter reported that weaknesses in the roof’s structure were found and repaired, which I have also verified. I can also add that the first girder added under Block 4 is in place and deformation on that strut has not changed. In my opinion, it is not clear that had anyone else spoken up that would would be able to say the same. That her decisions were supported implicitly by the other Engineers is important — no-one prevented her from carrying out those actions. We deeply regret Mr. Pelton’s death as a result of those decisions, but it is worth noting that Ms. de Leon was adamant that roof work was dangerous, and all Engineers are aware that going outside is very risky.”</p>



<p>Batesworth looked at Jo. “You’ve heard the opinions of the Populous and the Engineers. Do you have anything you wish to add?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I…” Jo gulped, the words retreated back. She shuffled in the heavily-worn seat, her chest heaving. Every facial muscle was engaged in a battle for expression, locked in an awkward stalemate with one another. She rubbed her throat and coughed lightly. She cleared her throat. “I wish things had happened differently.&nbsp; I wish I’d seen the storm sooner. I wish I had a longer rope.” She shook her head. “I wish we weren’t here.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You regret what you did?” asked Batesworth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo fought the knee-jerk reaction to respond, because she would have said “yes” without having actually thought it out. “No,” she said softly. “I can’t.” Reyes gasped. Jo met Reyes’s shock. “Because what I did will keep us all alive, at least for a while longer. Long enough that we’ll be safe.” Slowly, she felt a light brighten inside her darkness. She saw the landscape of her means, the color of its end. “I don’t like being responsible for someone’s death. It’s not something I want to carry for the rest of my life.” She looked up, and especially at Reyes. “But if that choice saves more lives than the one we lost, then it’s a responsibility I will take.” Reyes nodded curtly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Batesworth hummed for a few moments. “I think, Ms. de Leon, it’s fair to say that we will not absolve you of this accident.” He looked around and saw the nodding of both Erik and Reyes as confirmation. “You understand what happened, and that your decisions led to someone’s death. However, it was an accident and was not demonstrative of any malicious or premeditated intent. You are also remorseful of the event and its consequences.” Erik sighed quietly. Reyes continued to nod.</p>



<p>“Therefore,” Batesworth announced, “we find you innocent of the charge of murder, and must conclude that if there is any guilt, it’s from accidental manslaughter.” Erik groaned slightly.</p>



<p>Reyes looked at Batesworth. “What are you doing?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ms. De Leon, we cannot debate that your actions contribute to the whole, giving us at least another day upon this Earth. We would be foolish to consider banishment, but you must still face punishment for your inactions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Richard! We do not pass sentencing at tribunals!” Reyes barked. “Stop immediately!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We have the ability to provide a recommendation that the Council may hear,” said Batesworth without breaking his gaze at Jo. “As the Council is currently without a member, we are going to provide a final judgement to expedite our needs.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is not—!”</p>



<p>“Please, Agatha, let me finish,” said Batesworth. “Ms. De Leon, you are hereby removed from Council, though you will stay an Engineer. It will be made clear to everyone what happened, that you take responsibility for your actions. Further incidents where you attempt to take lead, however well-intentioned they may seem, will be immediately dismissed and any attempt to argue will incur further penalties. You will continue to report for maintenance issues, but you will report exclusively to Mr. Larsen for your assignments.” He turned to Reyes. “Is that acceptable, Ms. Reyes?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is not justice,” said Reyes. “You’re sweeping a problem under a rug.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“And what would you do, Agatha? Remove her entirely from supporting the roof over our heads? Allow more to be injured because Ms. De Leon is unable to react as swiftly?” Batesworth asked. “I have sat in many disciplinary meetings, they rarely end with everyone getting what they wish.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reyes grumbled and glared at Jo. “We’ll be watching.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’ll take that as agreement.” Batesworth turned to Erik. “And you, Mr. Larsen?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I agree,” said Erik, restraining a slight smile.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Batesworth stood. “Then this tribunal is adjourned.”</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Dust and sand sifted through the air alternately in loose particles, and in cascading rivulets collapsing under the force of gravity. The vacant space in Block 2 was trapped between an eerie emptiness and the angry rattle-bang of its exposed roof as the wind tried to rip the panels free. Atop a boulder centered in the chasm, Jo sat with her knees to her chin, staring at the canyon wall, as the dust settled upon her.</p>



<p>“Thought I’d find you here,” said Erik. He looked up from the base of the boulder, his hand blocking the settling sand. “May I join you?” he asked. A shoulder shrug was his answer. He climbed the boulder’s craggy parts and took an uncomfortable seat next to Jo. He shuffled a few times until the jagged parts of stone ceased trying to penetrate his ass. He looked around at the empty desolation. “You nearly died here, didn’t you?”</p>



<p>“Sí,” was the short reply. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m glad you didn’t,” he said. “Die, that is. Or even get hurt. How do you do that, anyway?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Do stupid things?” she mumbled through the crossed arms over her mouth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Not get hurt,” he said. Her eyes darted accusingly towards him a moment then returned to their stare. “Well, not physically, I mean. You fell, what 40 feet?”</p>



<p>“Maybe.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik shuffled again but said nothing else. The roof continued to act like a caged animal. His shoulders began to take on a reddish hue as the powder fell. “You’re not being banished,” he finally said.</p>



<p>“So.” Jo’s response was caught between a challenge and a dismissal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik opened his mouth and the start of something that would likely get him in trouble came out. He quickly shut up and rethought his point. “I know you were worried about banishment. That doesn’t make any of this any better, I know. I know… I … I don’t know how to … what else to say,” he trailed off. “Sorry, I don’t know why I came.” He started to slide off the boulder, but was caught by Jo’s hand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Stay,” she said. “Por favor.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik looked at Jo. “I want to ask if you’re okay, but that’s a stupid question, isn’t it?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No.” She straightened her back and dropped her knees. “I’m … I feel like this place.” She held out her arms to the vacancy of Block 2. “I don’t know what to do anymore, Erik. All I do is rush from disaster to emergency and try to help out and people…”</p>



<p>“Don’t care,” said Erik. “They don’t see it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Not until I kill someone.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Henry didn’t die because of you,” Erik said firmly. “Yes, he <em>died</em>, but not by any fault or intention of yours. You didn’t kill Henry, Jo. You didn’t force him out a door, or drop him off a roof, or throw him into the wind, or any of the things that anyone else has been opening their big mouth on. I ran into a lot of mouths who were convinced they knew the whole story and were trying to tell me how much they knew the facts. I think I nearly punched a couple of tunnelers when I was interviewing Dawn and they felt the need to tell me how you were the devil sent to kill us all—“ Erik stopped suddenly, his voice almost a shout in the space. He flushed and looked at Jo’s horror. “Oh. Oh my god, I’m so sorry, Jo, I didn’t mean to say that, I didn’t—”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo’s face softened and she placed her finger on Erik’s lips. “Esta bien, cariño. Thank you.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik’s confusing slid out from under his anger. “Uh, for…?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I know people have been badmouthing me. Carl apparently mouthed off to the guys in the workshop.” Tears seeped out and formed muddy trails down Jo’s face. “We’re going to die here.” She tried to wipe the wetness from her face but only succeeded in smearing the mud, creating streaks running from her nose almost to her ears. “This is pointless. None of what we’re doing matters. This place will collapse and kill us all.” She sniffed wetly. “What if we’re the last, Erik? The last humans? What if this is all that is left? When we’re gone, there will be no-one left to remember us.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re not going to die,” said Erik, softly. “Not here, anyway.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So we get buried alive in Carl’s deathtrap tunnels.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I still dream of being by the sea. A little cottage on a clifftop, overlooking a long, empty beach. Rolling surf, some seagulls, maybe a whale or two in the distance. Every evening, watch the sun set and the stars come out.” He touched Jo’s shoulder. “I want that to be real, Jo. I want to believe that we’re not here for any reason than to survive long enough to leave, get back to life somewhere else.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What if there’s nowhere else? How do we know that the world has been obliterated by the winds? Rich has never once picked up a radio transmission from anywhere. After all this time, wouldn’t others be trying to reach out, saying ‘we’re here’? We’re alone, Erik. We’re all that’s left.” She sniffed again. “And I don’t even know these people’s names.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No-one does, Jo,” said Erik. “You have any idea how long it took me just to find out Henry’s last name? We’re … all of us are like Block 2, Jo. We’re hollow, empty, destroyed by the wind that’s always trying to tear us apart. You can see our skeletons,” he pulled up his pant leg and showed his knee, his flesh so thin that it was possible to see the outline of the patella, “our life is as threadbare as it can get while still keeping us alive. Right now, this is all we have, this is what is keeping us alive long enough to get to the next place. Once we’re in the tunnels, we’ll start working out a step after that. One day, with luck, we’ll be somewhere else that is comfortable and safe.” He noticed the redness on his shoulder and brushed it off. “And a hell of a lot cleaner.” Jo burst a single laugh, a smile forced its way across her face. Erik reached out and touched her face. “That’s the Jo I know. You don’t give up. You fight. There’s no such thing as ‘hopeless’ to you. That’s why I…”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You what?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik reddened again. “I … admire you.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“‘Admire’,” Jo smirked. “Eres linda cuando tratas de decir que me amas. Espero que puedas decir eso algún día.”</p>



<p>“Huh?”</p>



<p>“Te amo mucho, cariño,” she said, giving Erik a quick peck on his cheek.&nbsp;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>“You were looking for me, Professor?” asked Carl as he entered Batesworth’s office.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You were supposed to be attending the tribunal,” said Batesworth, not looking up from the slates on his desk. “I gave you and Francis explicit orders to attend so we could deal with the Council decision immediately.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You said you wanted the tunnels opened,” said Carl. “We’ve been moving people in for the last two days. It’s taking every hand we have to get people moved and in place! Do you have any idea of how many beds—“</p>



<p>“Are you done with your pointless whining?” asked Batesworth. He rose from his chair to glare at Carl. “I gave you an order and I expect it to be followed.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>We are,</em>” said Carl. “Your order was to move people into the tunnels.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I told you to attend Jo’s tribunal!” Batesworth shouted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl stared for several moments. “Well, I didn’t. So what are you going to do about it?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I already did something,” said Batesworth. “You decided not to come, so I passed judgement.”</p>



<p>“Banishment?” Carl’s eyes gleamed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Batesworth made every move not to hide astonishment. “You are without a doubt the most callous person in here. If anyone should be banished for their behavior, perhaps it should be you!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“She killed a—!“</p>



<p>“No-one died by Jo’s hand!” Batesworth thundered. Carl cringed slightly. “Jo’s actions, whether you agree with them or not, will help the ARCH stand. That a person died is irrelevant. As I recall, you’ve had no less than a dozen deaths in the tunnels due to cave-ins, and so far you’ve never once sat at a tribunal to explain yourself.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Those are acciden—“</p>



<p>“Accidental deaths. Just like the one Jo witnessed when nature took its course. The only difference between Jo and yourself is that she took responsibility for it. You treat your tunnelers no different than batteries, throwing out the spent when they’re of no use to you.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I don’t have time to cry! We have lives to save!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There is always time to mourn the dead, Carl. Whether we know their names or not. Your callousness towards life is a liability here. I think you’ve been in the tunnels too long.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Professor, don’t—!”</p>



<p>“I think it’s time Dawn took over,” said Batesworth, his eyes drifting into thought. “She’s been in the tunnels a long time, she knows what’s going on, and given the state of their completion, she’s in a good position to ensure they’re finished properly.” Carl was speaking, but Batesworth couldn’t hear a thing. “Her experience with electrical and plumbing is perfect for this, actually. Then we can focus on getting the floors complete and make sure we get people in more quickly. I don’t know why I didn’t think of that sooner.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Professor!” Carl shouted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Hmm?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You can’t take me out, now, we are so close to having everyone set up with their own share of the space!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Share…,” Batesworth snapped his fingers. “That reminds me. Jo told me something about you allocating shares to the other Engineers. You’ve never brought this to Council, Carl. What are these ‘shares’ and what purpose do they serve?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl’s eyes twitched. “They’re, uh, we’re just making sure that we’re taking care of our own.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>How</em>, exactly?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Don’t you think it’s important for people to feel rewarded in their work?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“People are <em>alive</em>, Carl. Don’t you think that’s rewarding enough, given the conditions?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In here, sure,” Carl shrugged. “This place is going to fail.” Batesworth’s expression soured. “We’ve known this for months. That’s why we started tunneling! A safer place, more stable, more space for everyone. We’ll be comfortable! We can actually start having some civilization again, with better society and opportunity!” The sour sweetened, pushing Carl on. “So imagine if we rebalanced the equation again, Professor. When we started with the ARCH, it was just for us, the Engineers. We didn’t invite all these other people along for the ride, they forced their way in! They imposed themselves on us and we had to adapt to support them. We lost our personal spaces, we lost our advantage. We built this place and now we’re forced into corners because of them? How fair is that? Why can’t we make it better for us so that when we move into the tunnels, we take back our position as the chosen few?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“‘Chosen few’?” The sour returned. “To use Agatha’s term, that’s very classist, Carl. Why on earth do you want to do that. And as I recall, the only ‘<em>chosen</em>’ people here were my original class, all of whom were selected by <em>me</em>. If any classism exists here, it’s putting myself above you!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl’s mouth hung open. “Uh, well, of course we would naturally ensure that your share is … more …”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Amenable?” Batesworth proffered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yes,” Carl said slowly. “After all, you’re the Professor.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>Director</em>,” Batesworth corrected. “If we’re going to be changing things around here, I want to start with that.” Batesworth plunked himself in his chair and folded his arms, his eyes straying away again. “And this Council is done with. Once we’re moved in, we don’t need it. The ARCH will have served its purpose and the tunnels will support us. I’m tired of all the bickering, anyway.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Uh, Professor, I don’t think that’s a good idea.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We still need … governance. Your words, sir.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We <em>needed</em> governance. Now we need direction. And you are definitely not capable of that. None of you are. Once we’re in the tunnels, this will become an eminently different situation. In fact,” he faced Carl, “you’re going to ensure that my ‘share’ is at least … double of the other Engineers.” He chewed on the thought a moment. “Yes, reward is due, Carl. And you’re going to make sure that it’s set up that way.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Double?” Carl choked. “S-sir, I don’t think I can do that. I’ve … we’ve already set the formula and made promises—“</p>



<p>“Then unmake them,” said Batesworth coolly. “Come to think of it, Jo has been on maintenance now for at least three years. I think it’s time you two swapped places, and you can deal with the minor repairs.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl’s jaw clenched. “Double,” he agreed. “Hell, you deserve everything that’s coming to you, sir, why not make it triple?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Now, now, Carl, let’s not get greedy.” Batesworth swung around to his desk and riffled through a few slates, producing one that had long been smudged. He wiped it off and drew a box, filling it with a rectangle, circle, and a pair of architectural chair placeholders. “This should be appropriate, I think.” He held it arms’ length, admiring the look. Then he quickly added an alcove. “And my own private toilet.” He handed it to Carl. “Three days, and I move in.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl looked at the diagram. “I see.” He looked at Batesworth and smiled. “We’ll make it work.” &nbsp;</p>
