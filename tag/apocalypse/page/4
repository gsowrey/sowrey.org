<p class="has-drop-cap">Jo awoke alone in a room that she wished she hadn’t known: a round room with two doors, at the south-eastern edge of Block 9, on Level 1. The rope that had been put in her mouth remained. Her hands and feet were bound also with rope. She could hear the winds outside, just as harsh and shrill as they had been in the atrium. She realized she had no idea how long she’d been out. It was a brief moment of freedom from reality, which flooded back in a reeling rush.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik was dead. Someone had killed him. He’d been stabbed with her multitool, his face beaten in. And those were the things she remembered, images nearly burned into her retinas. She suddenly wished she’d remained unconscious. Her eyes teared up. Without others around, her body finally unwound, her emotions laying themselves out in their rigidity, heaviness, and pain. She dissolved in grief, and wept wholly and deeply. Her eyes ached, her heart swelled, her gut teared, her throat knotted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo let her head thump into the floor. She could feel her invisible wings, the ones she had used to wrap around the ARCH to protect it, moulting bare. Like a fall leaf, she could feel herself crinkle as the sap drained away, her colour wash out, and finally dry and crumble. The great echoes of her life’s meaning had dulled to a muted tone that huddled in the recesses of her withering soul.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She cried long and hard, unable to stop. She felt like she was six years old again, each sob spurring another in a self-repeating motion. It could have been an hour, it could have been a day, Jo let the tears flow and the sorrow embrace her like an iron maiden.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl walked into the room, followed immediately by Dylan and Gary, and the same two large Engineers that never seemed to put down their pointed poles. Carl sauntered over to Jo, and squatted next to her.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Comfortable?” he smiled. Jo let loose with a string of curses that she couldn’t get past the rope in her mouth. “I thought so,” he said after she stopped. He stood and backed up a few paces. “Well, then shall we get on this with this?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo suddenly realized that she hadn’t been chained there as prisoner. She started screaming through the rope while trying to stand, but her feet were strung to her hands. She tried to bite through the rope, talk around it. Every sound flowed together into a long multisyllabic vowel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Oh, your tribunal?” Carl asked, innocently. “We had it already. We found you guilty. And we’re sentencing you right now. No sense in delaying the horror, right?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo felt her blood drain. She tried to yell again. She looked at Donner and did her best to plead with him. Donner’s expression was terrible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yes, we know the wind is still strong,” Carl nodded. “But we can’t wait for it to die down again. For all we know, it might never stop. And we can’t keep such a horror like you around. What would the population say?” Jo jerked at her ropes, rolled hard against them. “I’d say I was sorry,” said Carl, looking at Jo thoughtfully, “but I’m not. Personally, I can’t wait until you’re out that door.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl snapped his fingers, and the two guards pulled Jo’s arms up behind her back. It was hard enough to elicit a muffled scream as the joints twisted unnaturally in their sockets. They dragged her over to the outer door, which Gary opened. Jo glared at Gary, who returned the gaze with a smile and a wave. The guards threw Jo into the room and pressed her face down into the floor. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Now, as I recall, everyone banished gets a knife,” said Carl as he walked into the room. The two guards pressed their points into Jo’s chest and thigh, keeping Jo in place. Carl produced the multitool in his hand, rinsed a little of Erik’s blood, but still stained. “Thanks for letting me borrow this.” He tucked it into Jo’s pants. He leaned in closer to Jo’s face. “You really did a number on him. When I found Erik in the greenhouse, he was really upset. He told me that he’d been an ass to you and how you’d punched him. Hell, the idiot damn near nearly cried on my shoulder. It’s probably why he didn’t see the knife before I slit his throat.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo snapped forward with a restrained shriek, trying to hit Carl with her head, but Carl moved out of the way. The spears plunged into Jo’s shoulder and leg, drawing blood and raising a sound equal to the one outside. As she struggled, she felt something heavy hit the ground in front of her. She looked for the sack she clearly hadn’t seen thrown in … but it wasn’t a sack. It was heavy, soft, slightly bigger than herself. It smelled of dirt and death.</p>



<p>Jo screamed. Even through the rope, it was clear. In the small room, the sound echoed painfully. Her ears split from the ringing. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“I thought you would have liked this, Jo?” Carl yelled through the doorway. “Did you not want to buried with your lover?” He laughed. “Any final words?” he asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“HUH HOO!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The floor dropped out from under Jo’s body, as it tilted to a forty-five degree angle downwards. She tried to cling to anything in dear life, but gravity performed its duty, and sucked Jo down. Erik’s body slid down the ramp next to her, ending nearly eight feet above the ground.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The gale swept in as Jo slid from the ARCH’s protection and immediately scoured her eyes. She slammed her eyes shut and tried vainly to free her hands. She felt her feet leave the end of the ramp. She flipped over onto her back, hoping to catch the edge of the ramp before she went over, but she was travelling too quickly for her hands to seize anything. She cracked one eye to see where she was headed. All she saw was Erik’s remains sliding off the end.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The force of the wind slammed her with an invisible sledgehammer, and pressed almost all the breath from her chest. It kicked up her legs, which flung up so quickly that it slammed her head into end of the ramp as she left it. She didn’t fall straight to the ground, instead being thrown a few body lengths down the slope of the valley floor. She lost the remainder of her breath crashing into sandblasted rocks. Sand raced into her open mouth, as the rope kept her from closing it.</p>



<p>The sand was only a momentary matter, as the wind picked Jo up like a tumbleweed, and threw her further down the hill. She gained speed so quickly that she became unable to determine direction or orientation. Then the ground seemed to disappear, and she felt the sensation of flying. She struggled to open her eyes, and saw glimpses of the immense rock walls that surrounded the ARCH, the beige sky, the mottled ground.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The last thing Jo saw was a large outcropping of rock, which got frighteningly larger at every glimpse as she spun erratically. She knew she was heading towards it, and at the speed she was moving, she had little doubt that she was going to die.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">The wind howled. It blew from all directions, putting sand and dust in any corner or crevice that hadn’t already received an allotment. The sand drifted in small dunes, until the dunes pressed into a barrier, forcing them to slither about to find a new route. It piled up, flattening out a landscape that had once been revered for its rocky sharpness, it’s harsh reliefs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There were few refuges. These occurred where the winds blew more in a steady direction, creating a leeward draught that functioned to draw sand away. A kind of a dry oasis in a storm of sand. At the leading edge of the ARCH’s canyon home, the wind wrapped around a four hundred foot precipice, creating an eddy in the wind. In that space, there was a large crack in the rock. Deep inside, there lay a woman.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo bolted upright to sitting and immediately regretted the motion, as her head suddenly registered a 217-degree shift laterally in combination with her near-90 degree vertical rotation. Her inner ear declared an abrupt independence and Jo slid onto her side, landing in a pile of fine dust. She coughed profusely before slowly propping herself up on her hands. Her head sagged as her body fought to re-annex her rogue vestibular system, producing a few waves of nausea.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After a half an hour, Jo manage to move without either falling over, or experiencing a crippling need to try vomit out her otherwise empty stomach. Her vision was slightly blurry, though it was still sharp enough to see the damage on her limbs: multiple bruises and scratches, a partially twisted ankle, a strained wrist, a possibly fractured left forefinger, most of her arm banged and carved into red-flecked streaks, her ass ached horribly, and there were two huge goose eggs on her head. She sat in the dust and flexed her hands to see if they even worked properly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Sorry, Kelly, looks like I took all the luck with me,” she muttered to the cave.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo stood carefully, with one hand on the wall for reassurance. It was dim where she lay, the light having scattered its way into the cave from its narrow opening a couple of dozen feet away. A pair of huge boulders, a few feet apart from one another, formed a small barrier, keeping the noise, wind, and sand at bay. She walked around the waist-high rocks, closer to the mouth, closer to the everlasting storm outside.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The wind whipped at Jo’s hair, flinging it around. But it was only the wind — there was hardly any sand at all. Jo needed only to squint to keep the specks out. There wasn’t much to see. The land outside was reddish and sandy, like every other part of the canyon that she had ever seen. Visibility wasn’t more than a dozen feet in any direction. The mouth of the cave, still several feet away, was riddled with large rocks that looked like they’d broken off from higher up the cliffs. The entrance swooped up sharply into a tight peak, the side flaring out to about twice the width of the chasm behind it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She stood, looking out into the desolation. “So much for luck,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Movement caught her attention, near the left side of the cave’s entrance. She squinted again, hoping that it might clear up her vision. It emerged from the sand, moving at an unnaturally low height from the ground, as if it’s legs had been cut off above its knees, its head was twisted almost a quarter turn from vertical, like the shape was trying to put its ear close to the ground. It was a few more moments before could see that it was a sheep, an animal she had never seen before in her life, but somehow knew that despite its motion, was dead. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Then Jo saw that the sheep was being dragged by a large cougar. She whipped behind one of the rocks before the large cat saw her and decided that a two-course meal would be appropriate. She huddled for nearly a minute before decided that the cougar didn’t have any plans that involved her. Slowly, Jo peeked around the edge of the rock, and saw the cougar using its huge, clawed paws and sharp white teeth to make quick work of the sheep’s belly. Tufts of wool skipped about in the breeze. The tawny animal purred loudly as it ripped pieces of mutton free from their former host, licking its chops after ever few bites.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo stopped paying attention to the cougar, and looked more closely at the sheep, noting a blue mark on its haunches. She looked back at the cougar, which despite the wind looked like any picture of a mountain lion she’d read about in books.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A pair of hands suddenly pulled her back and flipped her around. One clapped over her mouth, the other formed into a single finger moved in front of a pair of lips to indicate silence. The lips and hands were owned by Robert Ferris.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo nodded curtly. Robert slowly backed away, indicating that Jo should stay down, and then moved back inside the cave. Jo stared at her banished friend, then slowly got up and followed him. Some distance further past where she had woken was a small fire, over which was suspended a small metal bowl on sinew ropes. In the bowl was water, and what looked like roots. He squatted over it, gently stirring with a stick. He nodded to her silently and motioned her to sit.</p>



<p>“Don’t worry, the cougar won’t come back here. It doesn’t smell us, we’re downwind. It usually stays only around the entrance,” Robert explained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Usually,” Jo nodded slowly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I heard you screaming,” said Robert. “It sounded like you passed right by the cave entrance, going downhill. You must’ve hit a part of the outcrop, I found you on the ground. I thought you’d died, but you were still breathing, so I brought you back up here. I found a piece of rope in your mouth.” Robert finished, asking a question.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo reached up and touched the corners of her mouth, which felt raw and sore. The skin was cracked and scabbed. “They gagged me.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You must’ve bitten through it,” he commented.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo bit a couple of times, and noticed that her teeth didn’t seat properly. Something was out of alignment. “Ugh.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How’re you feeling?” Robert asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo instinctively felt her arms and head. “Okay… I guess.” There was an awkward pause, and she felt a need to inspect lower down.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I didn’t do anything,” he said, picking out the root from the pot. He broke off a small piece, chewed a moment, and put the rest of the root back in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo said the only thing she could think of. “Oh.”</p>



<p>“You don’t believe me,” he nodded. “That’s okay. I don’t blame you.”</p>



<p>“I do,” said Jo. “I … you said you were framed. How?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Robert sat back, and leaned his arms over his knees. “What do you know of my <em>supposed</em> crime?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Uh, well, I was told that you’d … um … beaten and raped a woman.” She felt much warmer than she cared. “I never believed it,” she added quickly. “Not you. No way. That sheep is more dangerous.” She jerked her thumb towards the entrance. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“So you don’t know.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The truth? I don’t think so. The trial was a sham.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Rich went along with it?” asked Robert. Jo nodded soberly. “Bastard never even talked to me.” He sighed and sat heavily. “Let me guess,” Robert mused, “you were set up for murder, right? I mean, I could see them accusing you of other things, but murder has a way of galvanizing people against you really quickly.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo gasped. “S-sí.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Robert shook his head ruefully. “You got in the way,” he explained. “You rocked the boat, or discovered something you weren’t supposed to see. You had to be eliminated.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They who?” asked Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Do you really need to ask?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Carl.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Uh huh. Who else?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Gary. He’s been Carl’s right hand forever. Probably Dylan, too.”</p>



<p>“And Frank.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Frank?!” Jo balked. “But… Dawn…!”</p>



<p>“Dawn’s not involved. Why do you think she was reduced to Carl’s errand girl? That was to keep her in the dark.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In the dark for what? What’s going on? Why the hell did all of this happen?” Jo searched her thoughts. “Did they kill Erik??”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Robert’s head snapped up. “Erik?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They…” Jo sniffed, and wiped a tear. “Carl told me he killed him. He used my multitool.” She dug out the handheld set of tools from her pocket. The tears formed a stream from her eyes. “They mashed his face,” she sobbed. “<em>And blamed me!</em>” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Robert looked straight at Jo, unmoved. Slowly, he extended a hand and placed it on Jo’s knee. Jo flinched at the touch. He quickly retracted it. “Sorry. I…”</p>



<p>“Esta bien,” Jo whispered and snuffled. “I… I, uh…” She closed her eyes and threw back her head. “I can’t believe this is happening.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m sorry, Jo. I am. You really loved him.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo wiped away more tears. “How… how did you know?”</p>



<p>“Because I saw the way you looked at him, even if he didn’t. It wasn’t respect or admiration, it was adoration. You wanted to be with him. I remember watching you in those god-awful Council meetings when Batesworth was going off on the need for proper structural reviews. You just kept staring.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I thought I hid it,” Jo smiled slightly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Did he ever know?” he asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah, we … he … I told him,” she said quietly. “They used it against me, didn’t they?” she sniffed.</p>



<p>“They framed you,” Robert said. “It’s a good thing Rich is still there or they’d…” His voice trailed off. The look on Jo’s face conveyed a novella of detail. “It’s only been … ten days? What’s happened?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo swallowed hard, wiping away the wetness from her eyes. “Rich is dead, accidental electrocution.” She blinked. “Actually, it might not be.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Robert slumped. “He was murdered, too?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“M-maybe. He touched a panel in the electrical room that had been intentionally shorted,” said Jo. “Someone wanted someone else dead.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Rich and Erik. And you banished,” Robert whistled. “They really are going to run the place.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If it doesn’t fall down first,” said Jo. “The roof collapsed in the atrium.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Was that an accident, too?”</p>



<p>“No se. The whole structure’s been shifting. We’d only just put in some girders in the greenhouse to keep it from slipping more. It … it could have been an accident.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How many rooms have they tunneled out?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Not nearly enough. We’ll be lucky to get half the people in there right now.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Is Smiley running the tunnels?” asked Robert.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Carl.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Gotta admire the guy, he twisted everything his way.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What do you mean?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Robert lay back into the cave wall. “Did you get shares?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo shook her head slowly. “How do you know about those?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Carl came to me a few months ago after we started tunnelling. He was talking about making sure that the Engineers got what was due: our own spaces, making sure we kept our place in the world. He tried to convince me that we should give out shares, making sure the Engineers had the most so we could have our choice.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You ever tell anyone?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Robert snorted. “I should have. But I brushed off Carl, told him he was being elitist. The idea was bad enough, trying to find something to represent a share was pointless. What were we going to use, rocks?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Then they found gold,” said Jo quietly.</p>



<p>“They told you?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I found it. They’ve been stockpiling it. I thought it might be for making wire for lighting.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Hmm,” Robert shook his head. “No.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Those are the shares, aren’t they? The gold coins?”</p>



<p>Robert spat a laugh. “Carl created his own monetary system. Labor for gold. You tunneled, you got gold. You get enough gold, you could buy a room.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>Buy</em> a room? But … those weren’t for sale! They’re for everyone, to save lives!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Carl didn’t care about saving lives. He just wanted to control the place. He wanted it his way.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I always knew Carl didn’t like the Council or how he never got his way, but … there’s no way he could do this without their support.” Jo looked hard at the fire. “Francis is on Carl’s side, isn’t he?”</p>



<p>Robert nodded. “Francis was in on the shares early on, mostly because Carl needed his turned into coins. Francis liked the idea of less work, and fewer people taking his stuff.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s not <em>his</em> stuff—!”</p>



<p>Robert looked at Jo and Jo trailed off. “His storeroom isn’t for him.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’ve only seen the stuff Francis wants you to see. He has another storeroom somewhere with all sorts of stuff in it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Like what?” asked Jo.</p>



<p>“Blocks of pig iron, barrels of oil and gasoline, sheets of glass, rolls of fabric. I even saw a couple of guns.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“W-what?” Jo whispered. “Guns? Fuel? Raw materials? We could have… so many people… You’ve actually <em>seen</em> all of this?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There’s a hatch in the floor of the workshop, under one of the tables. It’s really hard to see. I opened it once by mistake when I was moving a girder across the floor. Carl caught me replacing the hatch cover after I’d climbed out. He tried to act all cool and curious, and asked if I’d seen anything. I said ‘no’, of course. I told him that the floor panel had come loose and I was putting it back. I’m sure that put me on his watch list right then and there.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“And Carl’s in control, now,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“With you and me thrown out, Erik and Rich dead, there’s no-one left on the Council who didn’t side with Carl. They were all in his pocket.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Even Smiley?” asked Jo. “I mean, I thought he was always a fair guy…”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah, I don’t know about Smiley,” said Robert. “I always got the sense that he did things because he was told to do them, not because he agreed with them.” He shook his head.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Dawn?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Robert started to answer and stopped. His lip rolled a moment before he spoke again. “I don’t know. Dawn and I got along fine and we never talked about and of this. But she is married to Francis, so…” He sighed again. “Not that it matters anymore, not where we are.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Where <em>are</em> we, anyway? Is this anywhere near the ARCH?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah, it’s a few hundred yards up the valley,” said Robert, pointing through the cave wall towards the ARCH’s location. He saw the look on Jo’s face. “You’re not thinking of going back?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I want to help,” said Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You want revenge,” Robert corrected.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Engineers <em>help</em>, Robert. It’s what we do.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s what we <em>did</em>, Jo. We can’t help anymore. We’re not in control,” said Robert, hanging his head. “We never were, you know. Nature didn’t want us to have control. We’ve been fighting her for years just to survive. And it turns out we were wrong.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Wrong? How are we wrong by trying to save lives?” asked Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You saw them,” said Robert, pointing towards the mouth of the cave. “Out there, right now. Two animals. Both of them healthy. From everything we know of the Banshee, they shouldn’t even exist at this point. So how are they still able to survive? We failed.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How can you say that? The Robert I know doesn’t run away from a problem. The Robert I know smiles in a disaster and makes the problem run in fear!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The Robert you <em>knew</em> isn’t me,” he said, standing up. He motioned to the small pot on the fire. “That’s a root soup. It’s not the most flavorful thing, but it’s got a lot of nutrients. It’ll keep your strength up. Stay here by the fire.” He walked towards the entrance of the tunnel. “Get some rest.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Where are you going?” Jo asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“To watch the wind. It’s about the only thing to do around here.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">“Where are we going?” Jo asked, as Robert guided her into the depths of the cave.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo had to crouch a little, though not as much as Robert, to stay below the narrow top of the crevice. The walls looked like they should be rough, but were smoothened to the touch. Like the rest of the cave, there were random bits of rock strewn over the floor, forcing the both of them to walk at a slow pace so they could see with the dim fire Robert held in front of him. The shadows leaped into the blackness before and behind them, their footfalls echoing dimly off the erratic surfaces.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Robert didn’t reply, instead leading Jo around a variety of corners before winding up at the shore of a small underground pond. The roof was riddled with tiny stalactites, dripping into water so clear it was almost hard to tell that it was even there. He motioned to the pond, and handed Jo a cup. “Get it in you,” he smiled.</p>



<p>Jo didn’t argue, snatched the cup from his hand, and washed the dust from her mouth. The water was slightly salty and had a bite to it that reminded Jo of tasting minerals in one of her college classes. She drank four cups before finally handing the container back to Robert. Then she belched, the sound ricocheting like a grenade in the small space.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Disculpe,” she smiled, “y gracias.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m fairly sure this isn’t the best water for us given the salts in it, but death by dehydration is not something I want to experience,” said Robert. He drank two cups in quick succession.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I some how knew you’d survive,” Jo said, sitting down at the edge of the pond. The ground drew in water, quickly wicking into her pants; she realized that she had never recovered her underwear from Erik’s office. “You’re the one who found this canyon, you’re the one who found the spring, the one who managed to get the asparagus to grow, the one who found Smiley and started the tunnels—“</p>



<p>Robert tried to brush it away by waving his hand. “I didn’t do all that.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yes, you <em>did</em>, Robert,” said Jo. “You showed us how. Without you, we’d have been blown away out there on the scrublands.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>“I had a lot of help,” he said, “and support from people like you. Without that, we couldn’t have done anything.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You would have survived,” smiled Jo, indicating the tunnel and water with her hand. “You know how. I always admired that about you.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You … I didn’t know.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo’s stomach interjected.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Hunger is going to a challenge for you,” said Robert. “There’s not a lot here.” Robert crawled over to one side of the pond, and picked up a handful of whitish spidery tangles. “These help.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Those were the roots in the soup?” Jo asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Robert handed her one. “It’s nothing fancy. The roots are edible, the rest of the plant isn’t. There’s enough nutrients in one of those to cover about half your vitamin needs for a day.” Jo turned the root over in her hands several times. “It’s not the tastiest thing in the world—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’ll say,” she muttered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“—but you won’t die of malnutrition.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Just starve to death,” said Jo. “There’s no way there’s enough calories in there to keep you going.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No,” said Robert. He stood, and lifted his worn shirt. His ribs popped through his skin. “Not even close. If you don’t supplement with other things, you’ll waste away.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo eyed him cautiously. “Like what?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Whatever scuttles by, you don’t question it. You eat it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Qué asco,” Jo winced. “Seen any cows, lately?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Robert chuckled. “Nothing that large. Just the two cougars.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>Two?</em>”</p>



<p>“One male, one female. I’m not sure if they’re mates or not, I’ve never seen them together. I think they come to the cave because it’s a good shelter. But they never go far inside and never come at the same time. At least, not that I’ve seen.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What about the sheep?” asked Jo.</p>



<p>“Until yesterday, I hadn’t seen a sheep before down here,” said Robert. “That cougar must’ve brought it from somewhere else.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Do sheep go feral?” Jo pondered. “Maybe there’s a herd of them up there?” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Robert shook his head. “It was healthy. It’s being taken care of. It was domesticated.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo struggled against her false hope. “But… it could just be taking care of itself…?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Did you see its coat?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah…”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It was trimmed. Maybe a month ago, at the most.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Trimmed?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Robert leaned in. “Someone <em>sheared</em> it. That doesn’t happen naturally.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo’s heart leaped painfully. “¡¿<em>Qué?!</em>”</p>



<p>“Uh huh,” he said, “someone — somewhere out there — was taking care of that sheep.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“People are alive…,” Jo whispered. “More than just us…”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That’s what I’m guessing. Y’know, unless sheepdogs figured out how to use sheep shearers, anyway.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;“We need to find them! We need to let them know we’re down here! There’s ten thousand people who need rescuing!” Jo was nearly bouncing with excitement. “Forget the tunnels, we can be <em>outside</em> again!” Robert looked at Jo like she’d spawned a few more arms. “What?”</p>



<p>“Are you insane?” he asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“About?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You can’t go out there!” said Robert. “In that wind, you’d be dead before you got five steps out the door.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You survived,” said Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Robert slumped, then slowly pulled his shirt over his head. The skin that Jo had seen in the room before Robert’s ceremonious exit from the ARCH was caked with blotchy, dark red scabs. Some had already come off, leaving behind the angry pink new skin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“¡Dios mío!,” said Jo. She shrank a little, and asked quietly: “Is that from when you … when we threw you out?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah,” said Robert, carefully putting his shirt back on. “When I fell off the ramp, I lost my grip on my shirt. The wind took it pretty much clear to the other side. I was so pissed I threw rocks at the ARCH’s walls for about an hour.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I heard you doing that. Perdoname, Robert.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I was lucky that I found this cave so I could make it through the first night. Searched for three days before I finally found my shirt. I was on my way back to the cave when the winds came back. I wrapped the shirt around my head, and … well, you’ve seen the rest.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Perdoname,” Jo repeated, her eyes moistening.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’re not responsible, Jo—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yes I am! I was on the Council, Robert! We’re the ones who decided to banish you!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Did you vote to banish me?” he asked calmly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No,” she said quietly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Well, there you go. <em>You</em> didn’t throw me out. And since you’re now here with me…”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo’s stomach growled fiercely, the sound echoing in the small chamber. She looked down, then looked up sheepishly. “Heh, sorry. I guess I’m a bit hungry.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I can make some more root soup…?” Robert picked up a handful of the root clumps and held them out. Jo winced audibly. “Look, you need to eat something.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Like what?” she asked. “That soup isn’t enough. How are you surviving on this?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A couple of small lizards,” said Robert. “I’ve even managed to catch a couple of mice. I would love to catch a ground squirrel, or better yet a jackrabbit.” He sighed and sat on a rock against the wall. “But it’s been mostly insects.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo cringed. “Ugh. Really?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Hey, don’t knock it. You can do a lot worse than a couple of beetles for breakfast.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo felt her root soup starting to come back up. “¡Basta! I’m not ready for that.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Give it a few days. You’d be surprised at how quickly you change your mind,” said Robert glumly. “Oh, but don’t try to eat the centipedes unless you break their heads off first.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo had to clamp her hand over her mouth. She swallowed heavily for a few moments before opening her mouth again. “Another word, and you’ll be eating that cup.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Robert grinned mischievously. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“See, now <em>that’s</em> the Robert I know,” Jo jabbed her finger towards him. “The twit who’d sit to the side and make everyone squirm!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Old habits,” he explained. “It’s good to not be forgotten,” he said, smiling thinly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I don’t suppose that cougar left anything of the sheep?” asked Jo.</p>



<p>“They’ll only leave the skin and bones,” said Robert. He snapped up at a thought. “Though I could make some bone broth! That’ll do us both wonders. After the wind dies down, we’ll find some more wood, I don’t have enough to do a long boil.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ah,” said Jo. Her stomach growled again. “Is there enough wood for making more root soup?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah,” said Robert, standing up. He’d barely taken a step when he spied something moving in a shadow. “Don’t move.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Don’t… why?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Shh!” Robert went ramrod still and didn’t blink for nearly a full minute. Then, with a motion that didn’t seem possible from a man so gaunt, Robert shot his hand down, and returned with a three foot long, sandy-colored snake with diamond-shaped blotches on its back. It snapped about wildly, its rattle’s mode set to ‘thoroughly pissed’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo scrambled backwards and landed in the pond. “¡QUE CARAJO!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What’s the matter?” Robert asked innocently. “It’s just a rattlesnake.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo was having none of it. “<em>Just</em> a rattlesnake? Aren’t they … poisonous?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Very,” Robert nodded. The snake agreed, flaring its fangs. “However, there is a way around that.” He pulled out his knife, held it to the back of the snake’s head, and in a swift, clean stroke, swiped the head clean off, landing it on the floor near the wall opposite Jo. The rest of the body, surprised at the sudden decapitation, thrashed about for a few moments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That was… gruesome.”</p>



<p>“Well, it’s either that, or risk being bitten. And you don’t want to get bitten by a rattlesnake,” he said. “Incidentally, don’t touch the head. The venom’s still powerful and its reflexes are still powerful enough to break the skin.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Santo mierda, there is no maldito way I’m going anywhere <em>near</em> that!”</p>



<p>Robert hummed to himself as he started to walk back towards the campfire. Jo stared at the severed snake head for a few moments, then — her eyes levelled on the immobile head — slowly picked up what was left of the torch and followed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So, uh, what are you going to do with that?” asked Jo as she caught up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Robert turned around. In one hand was the snake, and in the other, the snake’s skin. Jo dropped the torch, nearly putting it out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“¡Mierda!” she carefully picked up the torch and blew gently to bring it back to life. She returned her questioning gaze to Robert.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’re hungry, right?” he asked. “Well…?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo’s appetite wanted to beat a hasty treat to anywhere else. Her stomach, however, argued in favor of potential food, irrespective of its source or appeal. “I… guess…”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Robert used his knife, quickly scooping out the former snake’s guts onto the ground next to the fire. Then he draped the limp meat over the frame that stood over the fire. He lowered it down as low as he could without putting the meat in the weak flames. “We’ll give it about a half an hour. That should do.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Is it safe to eat?” asked Jo.</p>



<p>Robert waved off the concern. “Oh yeah, there’s no venom in the meat.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Have you eaten snake before?” Jo asked.</p>



<p>Robert squatted next to the fire, and watched the cooking meat with care. “When I was about twelve, my mom got transferred to Dugway.”</p>



<p>“Ah, si, the base brat. You did a circuit between Dugway, Vandenburg, and Corpus Christi. You lived out of your <em>Star Wars</em> suitcase until you were a teenager.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah,” said Robert surprisingly. “New base, new kids, new friends, new enemies, it’s the way it always went. We had a neighbour—“</p>



<p>“Finney,” said Jo, her mind piecing together an old memory.</p>



<p>Robert looked Jo. “Finney,” he confirmed slowly. “My dad said he was Special Forces.”</p>



<p>“But Finney wouldn’t ever say what branch he was with,” added Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How do you know that?” asked Robert.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You told me.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Robert looked confused. “I… told you that?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, one night about a week after we’d finished the first ARCH. We were at a campfire and you were telling stories—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I remember a bottle…”</p>



<p>“—and you talked about Finney.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Are you sure?” asked Robert slowly, his memory slowly rebooting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“He took you survival camping!“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Hold on,” said Robert. “When did I tell you that? I never told anyone all that.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yes, you did!” said Jo. “He had a big dreamcatcher tattoo, right here,” she said, indicating her right shoulder. “You said that’s why you got yours.”</p>



<p>In the fire light, Jo saw Robert blink. “I’ve only ever shown one person that tattoo,” he said slowly. His eyes drifted as he desperately tried to find the missing dusty piece in puzzle of his memory. “That night … the stories … I went off into the dark with …”</p>



<p>“That was you?!” they both squawked. Their voices echoed rapidly in the cavern, followed immediately by a shrill laughter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo shook her head laughing. “I … wow, I feel bad that I didn’t remember it was you. Though now I can’t figure out how I didn’t remember.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Me, neither,” said Robert. They were both silent for an uncomfortable moment before Robert spoke again. “Was it any good?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s weird how this all suddenly floods back.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I don’t think it was bad,” Jo giggled. Robert smiled and blushed. He prodded the snake with his finger. “One weekend, Finney offered to take me camping. My dad thought it was great idea. I think my mom just about had a heart attack. We went way off into the back country. When we set up camp that night, he surprised me by saying he hadn’t brought any food.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Dios mío… That couldn’t have gone over well,” said Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think I cried for the first hour. Finney either didn’t notice, or pretended he didn’t. He built a fire, and then disappeared. I was about to panic when he shows up, throws a skunk and a snake next to the fire. He made it sound like this was the plan all along, and I was excited to be there.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“And you weren’t.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Oddly, I was starting to,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Even with the skunk?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Once he descented it, anyway,” said Robert. He turned the snake over. The smell of cooking meat wafted strongly about Jo’s senses. She swallowed at the mere thought of having meat again.</p>



<p>Robert continued. “He said the skunk was the main course, and the snake was a required appetizer.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That doesn’t really sound like much of an option…”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That’s what I thought at first. But it was either that, or starve. And I wasn’t too keen on starving. When you get hungry enough, you’ll eat just about anything,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m not eating bugs. No way!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Give it a few days.” Robert turned the snake again, and pulled off a small piece. “So how hungry are you?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo’s stomach growled in response. “What it said, I guess.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Robert held out a piece of snake. “Try a small piece first. I can tell you that it tastes like a mild chicken.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Quiero pollo,” said Jo, taking the small piece in her hand as if it were a biological hazard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Now imagine you’re eating you’re eating a really tough piece of beef,” Robert offered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo looked at the meat pinched between her fingers, and its cook. “That’s not helpful.” Jo took a deep breath and lobbed it into her mouth. True to Robert’s words, the meat did in fact taste like chicken, if someone had diluted the flavour in about a pint of water. And while the texture required a fair bit of chewing, she found it went down rather well.</p>



<p>“¿Más?” he asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“¡Por favor!” She picked away at the piece of snake, pulling out the meat between the ribs with her fingers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Well, that wasn’t a lot of food,” said Jo, licking her fingers, “but it was lot more fulfilling than the mushrooms I’ve forced down.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s really more of a rattle<em>snack</em>…”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo snorted. Then she guffawed. A smile ripped across her face, followed by a distinct titter, which lead to another snort, a restrained bark, and then all-out laughter. She laughed until she had trouble breathing. She laughed so hard her abdominals clenched. Her hilarity rang up and down the length of the cave. Robert sat and smiled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You really needed that, didn’t you?” Robert asked as Jo finally started to wind down.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She wiped tears from her eyes. “Oh sí, mi amigo,” she said. “I missed those terrible jokes.” She looked at the bones, discarded onto the fire, crackling in the heat. The glow of laughter, even the highly emotional situational kind, faded quickly. “Still, that was another creature. It was just minding it’s own business…”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I wouldn’t worry about it. That snake was old, maybe ten years. It led a good life. Think about where it was living — it wasn’t having any trouble finding food. And if it mated, I’m sure there are lots of other snakes out there with its genes. They’ll live long, good lives, too. Besides, I would worry more about yourself.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo looked worried. “Why…? I thought you said it wasn’t poisonous!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The meat wasn’t, no. Your body, on the other hand, doesn’t remember meat. Omnivore or not, you’ve been eating vegan for the last decade. Your guts have to remember what to do with animal protein.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo looked despondently at Robert. “You knew this was going to happen? And you let me do it, anyway?!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Robert smiled mischievously. “Hey, what are friends for?”&nbsp;</p>
