<p class="has-drop-cap">“What do we do?” someone asked. It was probably Bonnie, but Jo didn’t look to confirm. It didn’t matter. They were all on the floor, partly having their strength sapped by the sudden news, partly to avoid the overpowering stench.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We have to get the lights back on,” said someone else.</p>



<p>“How? We don’t know what’s wrong in there! The Professor died from it! I don’t want to die from it!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We can’t see where we’re going. We can’t grow food without light, and we can’t cook the food without heat. We’ve got to fix what went wrong.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s dangerous!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You want us all to suffer because you’re scared?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yes, I’m scared! You should be, too!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Woman up, the both of you!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I <em>am</em> a woman! I’m perfectly fine—“</p>



<p>“Then stop wimping out!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nearly everyone was shouting in short order. Jo just stared at her light, still sitting on the floor aimed at the ceiling. The batteries were slowly starting to die again, the hallway dipping deeper into darkness. No-one else seemed to notice. Jo wanted to get the light, wind it up again, keep the light going. But she couldn’t move.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The banshee cackled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What’s going on?!” boomed Erik’s voice. He had finally arrived from wherever he had been. The hallway went silent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Batesworth is dead,” someone finally said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik’s voice was a hoarse whisper. “What?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“He was electrocuted,” Jo whispered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik carefully stepped around his seated comrades, and looked around the door. He gagged, and swung back into the hall. “Oh, god!” He slid down the wall to the floor. “How…?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We don’t know,” said Phil. “He was already dead when Jo opened the door.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What do we do?” the same person asked again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik swallowed. “Uh…” He fought for purpose, for an action. “Um.” He fought against his mind’s wish to collapse. “We’ve got to get the power back on.” He finally said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“See, I told you!” someone sneered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Shut up!” another shouted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Quiet!” Erik hissed. “We’ve got to get the power back on. We can’t survive without electricity. We need to fix whatever broke … whatever killed the Professor. We … uh … we have to get in there. That means we need to remove his body.” Everyone went quiet, knowing what would come next.</p>



<p>“You mean … dump it?” Jo asked. There were few things you could do with a corpse in the ARCH. There was no available land for a graveyard, burial outside was nearly impossible due to the winds, there was no freezer to preserve remains.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No,” said Erik, shaking his head in the dimming light. “We can’t. Not him. We <em>need</em> to bury him. A memorial to his work. To this place.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Where? In the greenhouse?” someone balked. Someone else restrained a gag.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We can’t go outside!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The tunnels? We could seal him up at one end…”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Someone snorted. “I don’t want to be near that, do you?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Derision turned to shouting turned to name-calling. The hallway reverberated with argument, fingers thrown in the long, dim shadows, the shapes turning into a legion of demons swarming around the deceased. They stood, close to one another, yelling and fighting, all trying to usurp the decision to their favor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo, still seated, raised her hand. It remained up, barely lit, for over a minute before someone noticed. They quietened, as did the person next to them. The hush spread out like ripples in a pond until everyone waited for Jo to speak. When the last person went silent, she lowered her hand.</p>



<p>“Block 2,” said Jo. “I know just the spot.”&nbsp;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Removing Batesworth’s body had taken several strong people with stronger stomachs. His flesh had been burned, his body effectively cooked by the voltage that had surged through the wiring. Pieces of it had stuck to the railing he had been gripping, his hair had shed like pieces of charred paper. Their senses, long accustomed to a vegan diet, also had difficulty processing the scent of flesh.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Opting not to announce the accident to the ARCH’s population, the Engineers squirrelled Batesworth’s corpse to the lowest levels before taking it over to the base of Block 2. Using some scraps of wood and sticks that had been scrounged from outside, they made torches, lighting the way to Block 2 and allowing the other Engineers trapped in other parts of the ARCH to follow. Other torches were left in the atrium on the opposite side to turn curious eyes from following the funeral procession.</p>



<p>The drag lines from Jo’s body, where Donner had saved her from the sand, were still plainly visible. It took over an hour of continuous digging by four people — mostly to keep sand from falling back — to excavate a three foot deep hole; they could dig no deeper before hitting more rock. While they dug, Smiley chipped away on one of the boulders. Jo and Dawn built a small fire with sticks and scraps of wood to give off enough light for them to assemble.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Should we make a coffin?” asked Bob, as the gravediggers stood over their work. “I mean, he shouldn’t be buried just like this … right?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We don’t have the material,” said Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We should at least cover him with a sheet,” Phil offered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You have one handy?” asked Erik. Phil shook his head. “We’ll cover him with sand before bringing the others in. They don’t need to see him like this.” He looked at his mentor. “I wish we hadn’t.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Professor Batesworth was laid in the grave, his body covered with sand, before the rest of the Engineering team was brought in. Their shadows danced along the rough walls of Block 2, swaying like palm trees in an evening breeze. They assembled around the memorial, taking a moment to see what Smiley had carved into the rock:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Here lies Professor Richard Batesworth, Founder of the ARCH, Saviour of Souls”, and the date: “Died September 22, 2031”.</p>



<p>There was a discomfort beyond the funeral, beyond the sting of death. They shuffled in the sand, rustling their hands in their pockets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How old was he?” came a voice. It was Donner. “Shouldn’t there be a birth date?” The discomfort became palpable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We don’t know when he was born,” said Erik. “Not even his birthday.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The only sound was the Banshee above, and the crackling of the small and dying fire. There wasn’t a sniffle, not a single sob or sigh.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Someone should say something,” whispered Dawn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All eyes turned to Erik. He didn’t have to look to know, nor did he have to feel the begging stares. He clasped his hands and thought back to every obligation, calling, wedding, funeral, cotillion, graduation, baptism, confirmation, eucharist, bris, bar and bat mitzvah he’d ever attended. For a moment, his history went as blank as the rock before him: only the death that had just occurred.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Professor Batesworth was my teacher for many years, as he was for many of you. He was our mentor, our guide. His vision has allowed us to survive,” Erik said, his voice echoing in the high walls of Block 2’s empty shell. “I wish I could tell you more about him. But I can’t. He was a private man, who tried to lead a private life, even here. I saw him more than most, but even then it was always professional.” Erik humphed and smiled. “He was always professional. He refused to be anything else. He gave me my ring and reminded me of its importance, its meaning. To him, it was everything.” Erik looked around at the group. “And, maybe, that’s what has really kept us alive.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The tiny fire kept burning, kept smouldering, until after a few more minutes, only the glowing embers cast a painfully weak light. “We need to get the power back on,” said Erik quietly.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">“Dawn, I need you in the breaker room. Jo, you too. You’ve got the only working light. Everyone else, take some of this wood with you, find a place to build a small fire, and try to give these people some hope while we get the lights back on.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo came close to Erik. “Erik, we need know what happened.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I know,” he replied. “Do you think we need a couple of more eyes?”</p>



<p>“You know what Rich would be saying right now,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Bob!” called Erik. “And Phil! I need the both of you, too.” The two men stopped the exit and returned, everyone huddled in. “I need two things done. First, we need to find out — <em>quickly</em> — how Rich got electrocuted. We can’t be exhaustive, so I want anything that stands out, called out. Once we’ve got a decent idea, we can worry about rewiring.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Does Francis have any more of that wiring?” Jo asked Dawn.</p>



<p>“I took the last spool of the heavy gauge,” said Dawn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’ve got some in the emergency supply,” said Bob.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’ve got an ‘emergency supply’?” asked Erik. “Why the hell don’t I know about this?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There hasn’t been an emergency,” shrugged Phil.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik refrained an outburst. “Bob, go get that wire, please?” asked Erik. “Take a torch. We’ll meet you in the breaker room.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tormented souls had filled the inside of the ARCH in the time it had taken to dig Batesworth’s grave and bury him. Howls, shrieks, moans, and inhuman wailing leaked from the darkness, even though the doors and walls that separated the Engineers from everyone else. The sound came from every direction, seeping through the walls, floors, ceiling, railings, doors, sockets, and fixtures in a auditory ooze. Jo’s skin crawled the entire walk back to the breaker room. The banshee had found company with the ARCH’s inhabitants and taught them well.</p>



<p>Erik, Dawn, Phil, and Jo started where they had found Batesworth. His hand print — and a bit of his skin — remained on the railing. His other hand had been pressed onto a breaker box on the wall. They looked around the box, seeing burned wire casing, signs of melting and arcing. The box was nearly welded shut from the amperage that had coursed through it, and opened only with considerable protest. The inside was a mess of blackened plastic and half-melted metals, nearly unrecognizable from its original state.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Holy cats,” Dawn breathed. “I thought this was bad the last time. How the hell did this happen? You’d need to have had … do we even <em>generate</em> this much juice?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The wind’s blowing hard,” said Phil. “The turbines could’ve hit their max…”</p>



<p>“There’s breakers to prevent that,” Dawn countered quickly. “The only way this could have happened is if…” Dawn turned to Jo. “This was the same box we worked on last time, right?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo suddenly felt very defensive. “Yes, but—“</p>



<p>“We tested it, I know,” said Dawn. She turned back to the box. “And we still goofed. I nearly killed you, remember?” Phil looked surprised. “We doubled a wire by mistake.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“And I’m fine, thank you,” added Jo. “We fixed this. We went over it two more times before we turned it all on again.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>“So where’s the fault, Dawn?” asked Erik.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phil leaned in close and looked closely. “Someone shorted the breakers. They wanted as many amps as they could get. Whatever they were doing, it was intense.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yup,” Dawn nodded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Who needs that much power?” asked Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Francis,” said Phil and Jo simultaneously. Dawn continued: “His smelter is electric. That’s why the lights dim when he turns it on.”</p>



<p>“Has it been on a lot lately?” asked Erik.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dawn shrugged her shoulders. “I don’t know, Erik. I’ve been in those stupid tunnels.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Phil?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phil shook his head. “Yeah, a lot. I … I think he’s tried to run it hotter to everything done. He’s been complaining that it was too cold. I don’t know for sure, I’ve been running stuff between the shop and the tunnels.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Another accident,” Erik muttered. “Okay, what do we do? I want a longer investigation, but we need the lights back on.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We have to replace this panel,” said Dawn, whacking it with her hand. “Everything’s shot. And unless you got one hiding in your pants, we’re going to have to steal someone else’s.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How many breaker panels do we have?” asked Erik.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Four,” said Dawn, jerking her thumb further into the room, past the wiring racks. “Two of them deal with all the lights, one handles the kitchen. The fourth is unused; we disconnected it when we reduced the number of lights. And before you say anything, that one is too small to handle all of this. We’ll need a second one.”</p>



<p>“Or we rewire all the panels to free up a bigger one,” suggested Erik.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo tried to offer an idea. “So what—“</p>



<p>“We build a bridge out of scrap metal, isolate it, and hardwire one of the light panels using it. It means that those lights won’t be on breakers, but unless someone does something <em>monumentally</em> stupid, it’ll do.” Dawn stood with her arms crossed, daring a challenge. She didn’t receive one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bob burst in the breaker room, a large hand-wound spool of thick wire slung over his shoulder. “Got the wire!” he smiled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How much grief did Francis put up over that?” asked Erik cautiously.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“None,” said Bob. “He wasn’t there.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Good,” said Dawn, taking the wire from Bob. “Then he won’t know we’re using it. Any chance you grabbed side cutters?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yep!” Bob beamed, pulling out a well-used pair from his back pocket. “And these!” He pulled out a heavy cable cutter, the sort of tool that made everyone want to tuck their fingers away for safety.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’re the man, Bob!” Dawn cried, wielding the cable cutter like a broadsword. “Jo, shine that light over here?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dawn started cutting all the larger wires, freeing the box from its confinement on the wall. It had barely hit the floor when Phil scooped it up and hauled it away for recycling. Bob started unspooling the new wire and separating the old wiring to accommodate two panels. Dawn and Jo went towards the back of the room to free up one of the two lighting panels, while Erik and Phil hacked together a metal frame that would support the electrical distribution for the lights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo’s wrist had started to hurt considerably after winding the light for an hour. They tapped the next Engineer foolish enough to walk by to take over, while Jo lent her hand helping Dawn set up the new panels. They took a break only when Erik and Phil were ready to wire up the frame for the lights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The power had been off for close to six hours before Dawn was finally happy with their new configuration to brave turning the power back on. She checked the breakers, carefully marked with Dymo embossed labels (from an embossing tool kept in the breaker room that was self-labelled as: “Remove under penalty of death”), took a deep breath, and muttered: “Hold onto your butts.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>There were a series of loud clunks as the electrical connections were made to the turbines on the roof, and to the battery bank that provided light for the few times the wind didn’t blow, and the lights flickered back into being.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The cheer started low, then began to grow, until it was a thunderous revelation akin to a Hollywood moment when the world was saved from imminent devastation. None of the people in the room celebrated, instead staring at all the new wiring, separated boxes, and the new hard-wired frame that gave all of them more than a few worries. No smoke appeared, and at a hand’s span away, nothing was emitting enough heat to worry anyone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This sucks,” said Dawn, staring at her work, and the rest of the room. “What I wouldn’t give to rip this room out and redo it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It just has to last until we get into the tunnels, Dawn,” Jo reminded her. “Then you can gut this place.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I still want to know what happened,” said Erik. “Let’s remember that Rich died in here.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We all want to know,” said Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Bob, I want you and Phil looking this over in detail. All of it. Dawn and Donner’s tribunal will take place tomorrow, and we need evidence.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>Donner?!</em>” Jo blurted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>ME?!</em>” added Dawn.</p>



<p>“Why the hell are you putting them on trial?!” demanded Jo.</p>



<p>Erik looked hard at Jo and avoided Dawn. “You think I want to? You know the rules, Jo. You know—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You can’t do this! You have no proof it was them! They were fixing—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Rich is dead, Jo!” Erik sounded more like was pleading than being forceful. “We have to investigate. We have to have an answer for what happened. And at the moment, the last people known to have touched all this are Dawn and Donner. You witnessed that, right?” Jo offered nothing in response. “Let Bob and Phil do their job, and maybe they’ll be able to determine what actually happened.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’re putting an innocent people on the firing line,” Jo protested.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If they’re innocent, then nothing will happen and we move forward. But if there is something — even if it’s a mistake — we still have to understand what happened,” Erik persisted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo pressed close to Erik and spoke low. “I don’t trust Bob and you know it. Don’t them scapegoat anyone. Don’t make me regret holding out for you.” She turned and left the room, leaving a very puzzled Erik behind.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Jo was banned from the tribunal. She had protested. Erik had argued. Reyes had humphed. And Bob had blocked the door, keeping Jo from being even within earshot of the closed door. Jo wasn’t worried that Dawn or Donner wouldn’t get a fair trial; as much as Reyes tended to be harsh, Erik tended to be light, and Erik had agreed to put Bonnie on the Tribunal instead of Francis or Carl. Where Bob’s priorities fell was another matter and it wasn’t clear if his findings would be biased, but somehow Jo’s gut said not to panic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, she couldn’t sit in the hallway outside the Engineer’s Office. Being unable to listen or act on anything she heard led her to pacing a short distance in front of the door for a few minutes before finally marching off to keep her mind occupied doing something else.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo went to the stairs to head down to the greenhouse to talk with Anita. Only when she got to the bottom, she stopped. With a terse sigh, she climbed back up to the hallways. But what to do? The inability to talk to either Donner or Dawn, or Erik for that matter, closed off most of her readily available sources of information. While the gardeners were always a welcome distraction, they worried about food, not about structures or electrical circuits…&nbsp;</p>



<p>The answer to Jo’s need to investigate came like a break in the clouds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The breaker room looked the same as she had last seen it. An odor that was a conglomerate of copper, hamburger, sulphur, and plastic still hung in the room, coated onto the boxes and wires and railings and floor. Jo tried not to think of where the smells had come from and focused instead on what had happened. Or possibly had happened. The room had been purged of evidence, and repairs already conducted to keep the place functioning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What had Batesworth been doing? Why had he come into the room in the first place? Had he come into fix something? Had a light gone off? Jo thought carefully about how she had seen Batesworth the day before, trying to replace his corpse with a mental mannequin. She walked to where he had been found. He had been standing, his muscles having been seized into place, keeping him upright. One hand was on a railing, the other on the panel box. The panel box that Dawn had removed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The one that Phil had taken to the shop to be recycled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo ran to the workshop, as fast as one could run through a place with completely overcrowded spaces. The door to the workshop was closed and locked. Jo knocked on the door three times, getting no answer. Having no key to the door, Jo pulled out her multitool.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Separating it into two parts, Jo unfolded two very thin rods, one on each section. What the rods were originally intended to do had long since been forgotten; they were now whatever they needed to be. She inserted both into the lock and quickly started to rake the tumblers. She jiggled one rod while pressing down with the other. She listened intently for the sounds of something giving way. Fortunately, everything in the ARCH was loose after so many years of use, and locks were no different. A clicking, combined with a turning of the tumbler, revealed her success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She entered quietly and carefully, thinking about the act she was carrying out. Why was she sneaking around, anyway? She had as much of a right to be there that Francis did, after all. Except for the supposed demotion, anyway. Her privileges were gone. She was still an Engineer, but Francis would certainly be angry with her breaking into the workshop “without reason”. Would he care if she said she was looking for the panel box? Francis would bring it up in Council. The others would push to have Jo restricted even further, or kicked out altogether. She closed the door carefully and relocked it.</p>



<p>The workshop was deserted. Jo could feel heat from the smelter, which was roaring up to its next job. She darted over to the collected piles of scrap metal, most of which looked like it had come from outside, but was unable to find the panel box. She checked the other shelves and cubbies, in the chance it had been stored in a different location. The box was nowhere to be seen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The small door on the side with the heavy bolt attracted Jo’s attention. She had seen Francis exit the door a few days earlier. The lock was old and worn, like the bolt that had kept the workshop door closed. She pulled out her multitool again. Though a bit more stubborn than the main door’s lock, it could not resist Jo’s technique and soon popped open.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The room beyond the door was larger than Jo had expected for such a small portal, measuring roughly fifteen feet by four feet, going well into the rockface. Every wall was a heavy shelf, leaving only a narrow space in the middle. The shelves were nearly filled with old crates, which refused to budge when she tried to move them, and clinked when jostled. She opened the lid to one of them, reached in and pulled out a small metal coin that glinted a bright yellow even in the low light of the room. “¿Que es esto? ¿Una moneda? ¿Por que tienes monedas, Frank?” She pocketed the coin and replaced the lid. She searched the other shelves, looking for the panel box. The variety of stocked items quickly blurred as her urgency rose: tools, wire, metal bars, wood blocks, blobs of mould wax, fabric, broken blades, crucibles, mismatched and heavily patched gloves, face shields, helmets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The workshop doors clanged as they were being opened. Jo burst from the small room, quickly closing the door. There wasn’t time to slide the bolt back and lock it. She paused only long enough to decide whether to go back into the room and hide, and not know if she was going to be found, or hide behind something else. As someone came through the doorway, the decision became moot and Jo dived behind the only thing large enough to shield herself: the smelter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The smelter was a large machine, easily able to hide two or three people behind it, mounted on heavy triangular frames that allowed the cauldron to pivot. The cauldron was roughly tear-shaped, with the thin end blunted, being an opening for loading and unloading. The cauldron roared as great fans blew in air to heat the insides and form a protective layer to keep the molten metal from melting out the sides. The unit produced horrific heat. Even with her shirt shielding her face, it felt like it was burning like a blowtorch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Several people walked into the workshop. The smelter blocked almost all view, which kept Jo hidden but also kept her from seeing who had arrived. She carefully turned and peered around the side, and caught glimpses of Francis, Phil, Bob, two other Apprentices on Francis’s crew … and Carl. Each of them had carried a large plastic bin, which they heaved onto one of the tables. Even though the roar of the smelter’s blowers had drowned out most of the sound, she could feel the thumping through the floor. Whatever they held, it was heavy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They talked about something. Whatever it was, she couldn’t hear. And try as she may, Jo couldn’t read lips. Then Francis pointed to the small room she had left unlocked. The others turned. Despite her skin boiling, she felt frozen. Then Francis pointed to the smelter and everyone turned again. Jo disappeared behind the machine and bumped into something. It hadn’t been attached to the smelter, as it moved when she hit it. She glanced around, and spied the panel box that had been removed from the breaker room. She shuffled on her hands and knees to face it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Suddenly, the smelter moved, its electric motors whirring as it tilted the massive cauldron down. Peering just underneath, Jo saw a mould being kicked into place. Someone was wearing heavy protective clothing — at least from the knees down, which was all she could see — and positioning things carefully. The base of the cauldron, carrying the duct work for the blowers, started to press Jo into the wall as it came closer and closer. The ducts were heavy and glowed a dull red from the heat. Jo could feel her skin wanting to burn and blister and her clothes were painfully hot. She could smell her hair starting to singe. The cauldron slowly stopped and the mould was adjusted. The motors whirred again, lowly, and the cauldron crept further horizontal, then dipped just beyond horizontal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A thin stream of bright liquid poured down into the mould, a shiny, glowing reddish-yellow. The pour lasted only a moment or two before the cauldron was tipped back up, and returned to its former position. The mould was pulled away with a rod. Jo spun around again and tried to peer around the corner. Sweat was pouring over her face, and seeing anything clearly was difficult. She could see Francis, dressed in his protective clothing, and Carl looking into the mold, nodding appreciatively. The others had apparently left.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl said something, Francis responded and started to remove his protective clothing, putting it on the table next to the crates. Then the two of them headed back towards the door and left. Jo waited only a moment before diving back out from behind the smelter, falling flat onto the floor. For the first time in years, she felt genuinely cold. Still not wanting to get caught being in the workshop, she couldn’t enjoy the feeling for long. She rolled up, and … paused.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She wanted to look at the panel box, her reason for being in the workshop. But her curiosity begged her to look at whatever it was that had been poured in the mold, and what had been brought in the crates. Her paranoia won, and she first checked to make sure the door was locked. She could at least hear it being turned, and would hopefully gain a few seconds to hide again if someone returned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Curiosity came next, starting with the crates. They were filled with what looked like dirt: small rocks, bits of dried soil, flecks of quartz. She sifted her hands through it, unable to parse why they’d bothered to bring such junk to the workshop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She turned her attention to the mold, still sitting on the floor. It was still hot, radiating out the heat that had melted whatever it was that had been poured into the mold. Inside, she saw a bright yellowy metallic surface, which had started to loose some of its lustre as it cooled. She remembered the coin she had taken from the small room. She dug it out of her pocket, and saw it clearly in the brighter light of the workshop. There was no mistaking what she held. <em>“</em>¿Oro?”A thought crossed her mind and Jo returned to the crates, digging through two of them before finding a tiny little yellow nugget. “Están extrayendo oro.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>They found gold in the tunnels, presumably. Gold was an excellent conductor and could be spun into wires. With copper in such short supply and the need for a lot more wiring, it made sense. It would be a strangely luxurious resource to use, but it would be effective. The coins would be a convenient way of storing the gold before being worked into something thinner. And given the historical value of the commodity, the security was understandable. Jo nodded to herself. “Buena idea, Frank.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Curiosity sated, Jo returned to the panel box. In the brighter light, it was easier to see the melted and burned plastic, the pieces of wire that had nearly exploded under the severe voltage. Ground zero, where the arcing had been most severe, seemed to almost come from the back of the box. She tried to pull out some of the breakers to get a better look, but the ones blocking her view were fused right into the box’s distribution frame. She flipped the box over, in hopes the back might have melted off.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It hadn’t. Instead, she found a rough hole, looking almost torn open, about three inches square. She peered through the back and saw the rails on which the breakers were mounted, which were heavily distorted from heat. A thick mass of shiny copper laid across four of the breakers, effectively connecting them into a single unit. Had that been the source? <em>&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Jo flipped the box back over and saw bits of material caked to the surface of the melted breakers. She was about to pick some of it away when she realized what it was: parts of Batesworth’s hands. The outline of a handprint was clearly visible. It had been his right hand, the outline showing the clear gap where his engineer’s ring had been. She followed the outline to figure out where the forefinger had been. The breaker had been melted away, but it was clear that Batesworth had been attempting to reset something when he’d been killed. She flipped the panel back over again and matched up the shorted breakers with the one Batesworth had touched. It was then she realized that the short would only have taken effect if the breaker was turned back on.</p>



<p>Opting not to run, Jo returned to the breaker room casually, as if she were going about her regular duties. Opening the door to the breaker room, she nearly ran right into Erik, who was in the act of exiting the room. “Erik!” she blurted, jumping. “What are you doing here?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik looked at Jo. “I should ask the same thing.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo looked at Erik. She closed the door behind her. “I’m trying to find out who sabotaged the panel,” she said quietly.</p>



<p>“So am I,” said Erik.</p>



<p>“You are? But, how—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Dawn said she’d found it during her investigation,” said Erik, “but didn’t say anything with everyone around. She told me that she’d found a heavy wire at the back of the panel before Phil took it away. She didn’t get a chance to look at it closely, but she thought it might be the cause.”</p>



<p>“It was.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What? How do you know that?”</p>



<p>“I broke into the workshop,” Jo confessed. “I looked at the panel box. I found the same thing. It looked like someone put it there with a hatchet.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You <em>broke </em>in?”</p>



<p>“No-one was there and I didn’t have a key!” Jo protested. “I didn’t want to wait. Besides, it looked like they were hiding it from everyone.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik breathed annoyedly. “I hope you weren’t seen.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I don’t think so,” said Jo. “I’m sorry, Erik, but I didn’t want Dawn and Donner to be in trouble for this.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik put his hands on Jo’s shoulders. “It’s alright. I’m just … this is a tough time, and I’ve had everyone coming to me for everything.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo clasped her hand gently on Erik’s face. “I’m sorry. I didn’t know. I wish I could help.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Just try to stay out of trouble?” Erik smirked. “Dawn and Donner have been acquitted, by the way,” he added. “Phil testified that the wiring was proper when he saw it the night before. Even Agatha was convinced.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Someone sabotaged the box,” said Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The question is ‘why’.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah,” said Jo. She looked at Erik. Outside, the winds continued to howl. “It looks like the banshee had help.” The cyclone protested the suggestion.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">The phone in Jo’s pocket beeped and vibrated. She pulled it out and looked at the screen. It read: “13” and “4/7”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Oh crap,” she said. “Another roof breech.” She instinctively looked up. “We’re practically underneath it!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’d better go look, then,” said Erik. “We’ll talk about the,” he looked around and lowered his voice, “we’ll talk about the incident later. I’ll be in the office, okay?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Okay!” Jo turned to run off to the breach, then stopped and turned back. “Rich isn’t there, Erik.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I know,” he said. “There’s probably a dozen people there looking for him.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Are you going to tell them what happened?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Not yet. I think … we should probably tell Agatha first. Y’know, people’s representative.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So you’re … doing Rich’s work?” Jo asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik shrugged. “Sort of? Make sure things keep moving until we find a new normal. Someone has to be the mediator, right?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“But you have your own work. You can’t do it all.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What else do we do?” he asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We should…,” Jo caught herself, and remembered her situation. “<em>You</em> should elect someone to replace your role on Council. Then you take over as the lead, I guess?” She chewed her lip for a moment. “I assume you’ve already replaced me?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Actually, no,” said Erik. “We hadn’t gotten to that yet.” He looked at her eyes. “I suppose you could return…”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo shook her head. “No. The tribunal decision needs to stand. We shouldn’t reverse it. It … I … that would suggest that what I did doesn’t matter.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Things have changed,” Erik offered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The present has changed. The past hasn’t,” Jo smiled grimly. “I’m still at fault. You can imagine Agatha’s objection if you bring me back.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik nodded soberly. “Yeah, maybe you’re right. We’d need elect two more to Council,” he mused, quickly adding: “You’ll stay under me.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>They both looked at each other in mild surprise, both faces slowly evolved to display the same sly grin. “Espero que sí,” Jo finally said. “I’ll see you later!” She turned to leave, stopped, then quickly spun to kiss Erik gently on the cheek. Saying nothing more, she took off to the nearest staircase.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Jo hit the stairs, she could hear the unmistakeable sound of a breech in progress above. It meant that it was fresh, it hadn’t been barricaded, and it was going to be nasty. She had to fight against a flood of people trying to get away from the imminent hole, fleeing to the lower levels. She dug into one of her other pants pockets and fished out an old pair of swimming googles. She had them on by the time she got to the top.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The wind was whipping around from up one of the hallways, which led towards the canyon wall, where the ARCH’s roof met the rock. She followed the breeze, until she saw the large crack that had formed. There was no-one else there, nor any equipment prepped to work the problem. <em>One of the population must have called it in.</em> Though her goggles were scratched, she could see that one of the clips that held the roof panel in place had cracked, and part of the roof panel had peeled up. It wasn’t a simple patch: the roof panel would have to be removed and replaced with a new one. And in the gale force wind, it was going to be a tough job.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The floor was starting to accumulate sand at a fast pace, the grains being rammed through the gap at a terrific rate. Jo tried to get close to get a sense of how badly the clips were damaged, but she could feel the sand trying to tear her skin free, the pain eliciting a vision of Henry blown off his feet and disappearing into the sandstorm. She backed off and went to go find the portable wall.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The portable wall was usually kept at the east end of Block 4 on the top level, as the wind patterns tended to cause more damage to the eastern side of the ARCH. The portable wall folded into an eight foot by eight foot by four foot block, mounted on a set of four large wheels. This made moving it around easier, as the wall was also quite heavy. She pushed the block down the hallway, back towards the breech in the roof. The hallways on the uppermost levels had long since had their panelling removed, most of it used for repairs in other areas, or burned for cooking heat during a blackout years earlier. The bare metal studs and struts made it easier for Jo to clip in the portable wall’s anchor, preventing it from moving around while she unfolded it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The wall was erected in stages. First, it was brought across the width of the hallway (and angled in cases where the wall was wider than the hall), which would keep the base in place. Braces were then extended to the floor to keep it from being pushed around. The next level was then lifted up into place, which was locked to the walls, with more braces folded and locked into the first level. This continued until the wall had reached the ceiling. It was never a perfect fit, nor was it meant to be — the wall’s purposes was to protect the supporting team behind the wall, while others were working to seal the hole.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She pulled off her goggles and looked through the plexiglas window. It was easier to see the damage, and it wasn’t good. “Panel, pre-clipped,” she said to herself. Near the walls, the panels were different sizes, owing to the canyon wall’s irregularities. The one that was being slowly torn away looked like it was fairly standard, but it was hard to tell with the deformation. Like all panels, it was numbered: 4-953. “Two people,” she cursed. There was no way to avoid the problem of needing the panel to be held in place while another secured the clips. She reached for her phone, and texted out a reply: “10 4-953 1 2”. The codes were kept simple so people could easily remember them. It wasn’t a hole, it was critical, and she needed a second person.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo ran off for the suits. They were kept next to the portable wall when not in use. There were two, both former motorcycle suits, one slightly larger than Jo, and one quite a bit larger than Jo. One had once been black leather, with a dark red helmet; the larger one was all white. The white had been mostly chipped away, the black scraped clean from the shoulders, arms, and hands, as well as the upper back and front. She gathered the suits and helmets, and raced back to the wall.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next part was the panel. Jo bolted for the workshop, hoping that the page had already been received. With luck, she would only need to grab the prepped panel, return to find someone waiting, and get the new panel in before too much sand had fallen into the gap between the portable wall at the outside edge of the ARCH. In the past, the task of removing the sand had been an annoying burden; now it was a real threat to the ARCH’s safety.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The workshop door was open and work was proceeding inside on … she didn’t bother to look. “Did anyone get my text? I need a roof panel!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah!” one of the guys replied, hauling a piece of metal sheeting that had a hole that would match the piece she needed. “Phil just left with it!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ah, nuts!” Jo cursed, spun, and bolted for the stairwell. <em>How did I not see him? </em>She bounded up the stairs two at a time, accidentally landing on someone’s hand along the way. She threw an apology over her shoulder as she rounded the bend and continued up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phil had already arrived at the portable wall by the time Jo returned. He was suited up in the white suit. The black suit had somehow figured out how to stand on its own. “Hey, Phil!” called Jo loudly as she approached. She made it within a few paces of him before a hand stopped her. The hand was attached to Carl.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They’ve got it,” he said curtly. “You’re not needed.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What?! This is <em>my </em>assignment, Carl!” shouted Jo over the wind. “I already set the rest of this up. You’re the one who doesn’t need to be here!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They’ve got this,” Carl repeated, jabbing his finger into Jo’s shoulder. “You’re not <em>wanted</em>. Is that more clear for you?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What the hell has gotten into you?” Jo demanded. “You run the tunnels, I do maintenance. Why the hell do you need to show up here?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl pressed right up against Jo, partly to be heard but mostly in presence. “We don’t trust you.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’ve made almost every roof repair in the last year! I can patch this, all I need is one more person—“</p>



<p>“So you can kill them?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“To give me a hand keeping the patch in place, ¡cabrón!” she shouted. “The tribunal determined it was an accident!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“And what about Batesworth? Was he an accident, too?” he shouted back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo mouthed an unheard curse. “He died because someone sabotaged the box!”</p>



<p>“You couldn’t stand that he put you on trial, could you?” Carl sneered. He caught Jo’s inbound hand before it struck him. “So predictable. You have a temper, Jo, and its getting people killed.”</p>



<p>“<em>Fuck you, Carl!</em>” she screamed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl produced a heavy wrench in his other hand. “<em>Leave!</em>”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Have it your way, Carl!” said Jo, pulling herself away from his grip. “Try not to let the place collapse, okay?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo walked away, her body at a noticeable tilt from both her momentum and the wind. Carl was turning into a real pig. No, that wasn’t fair to pigs, pigs at least had personality. Carl was more like an obstinate donkey … or a llama. Though with Carl, he spat words.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As she started stomping down the stairs, Erik’s conversation returned. <em>We’d need to elect two more to Council</em>. The Council was already stacked in Carl’s favor, with Erik now the outsider. Jo shuddered at the thought of Carl being in charge, of having any more power than he already seemed to possess. How hard Carl had managed to pass Batesworth’s interview? Batesworth had rejected anyone who didn’t work well with the rest of the team. Carl was a late addition to the class, too, and had never really blended well with the others. He’d resented Erik’s seniority as the TA from the first day and had tried to wrest control of the projects at every turn. Batesworth had kept Carl in check for years. With Batesworth gone and Jo off the Council, Carl was a wild animal let loose from its cage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The lineup outside the Engineer’s Office had no less than twenty people waiting to have their say, get their needs fulfilled, whine about someone they disliked (something Jo was preparing to do), or whatever else it was that people had talked to Bateworth about. Erik sat at his desk, Batesworth’s office left open and vacant. Jo walked over to Batesworth’s chair and sat in it, looking through doorway at Erik. Erik glanced at her and scantly waved. Jo waved back. Then, spying some evil looks from others waiting to talk to Erik, she held up her hands, indicating that she wasn’t trying to skip the line, which of course, she was.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A moment later, the person meeting with Erik — presumably an Engineer — left and Erik stuck his head around the next person. “That was quick,” he remarked. “I think that’s a record, even for you!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I didn’t fix it,” she replied. “Bob and Phil are.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“‘Are’? As in, ‘not fixed yet’?” he asked. “Why aren’t you up there supervising, then?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Carl’s supervising,” she replied. “He told me to go away.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Carl…?” To the protest of the line, Erik walked over to Jo. He looked back. “Sorry, folks, this is important. We’ve got a roof breech. I’ll only be a moment.” Instead of going into Batesworth’s office, he went right for the Council room, Jo followed and closed the door behind them. “What is Carl doing with a roof repair? He should be getting the tunnels ready!” Erik exclaimed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That’s what <em>I </em>said! Then he ordered me to go away.”</p>



<p>Erik looked confused. “You’re the best roof repairer we have. Sending you away is moronic.”</p>



<p>“Stupid is as stupid does…”</p>



<p>“Hey,” cautioned Erik. “Carl might be difficult at times—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Often.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“—but without him in the tunnels, we wouldn’t be as far ahead as we are now.” Jo stared at Erik for several moments. “I know what you’re going to say—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Then don’t make me say it. You’re parroting Batesworth. You don’t believe that the tunnels are in good shape and know the delays are all Carl’s doing, so don’t tell me that things are good. The tunnels are Robert’s baby. We owe <em>him</em>, not Carl.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik sat in one of the chairs and tilted his head back. “I’d kill for an aspirin,” he muttered. “You know I have to try play politics here, right?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Why the hell are we dealing with politics, Erik? We’re supposed to <em>surviving</em>, not negotiating. Playing to Carl’s ego just helps his ego, nothing else.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That’s your opinion,” Erik pointed out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Stop doing Batesworth on me, Erik!” Jo shouted. “You’re <em>not</em> Batesworth. He was objective to a fault. We don’t have time for objective!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Do you think Carl won’t get the roof fixed?” Erik asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That’s not the point, Erik!” she whined.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Actually, it is. Why else did you come here?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo eyed Erik. “It almost feels like I don’t know you. I thought you were on my side, here?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m on everyone’s side, Jo, you know that. I’ve always been the middle guy. You’ve always wanted things your way. You’re usually <em>right</em>, so it’s not that you don’t have your reasons, but you can’t stand there and tell me that you’re the only one who can do it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Well… no,” Jo admitted. “It’s just that…” Jo tried to remember what the point of her argument had been. “It just seems wrong. Why is it all suddenly changing?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I won’t argue with you, there. You might as well be the one leading the tunnels, if he’s going to be fixing the roof,” Erik chuckled. Jo humphed. “Look, I can’t tell Carl not to do what he did. So long as the job’s being done well, the only thing wronged here is your pride.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That doesn’t make me feel any better,” Jo frowned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I know,” said Erik, standing up. “It’s an adjustment period. Once we get settled down in the tunnels, we’ll find a new normal. Until then, let’s just try to keep things calm.” Erik placed his hands on her shoulders again. “Okay?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Okay,” Jo mumbled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Thanks,” Erik smiled. “How are those girders coming along?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“One’s in, Donner and I are trying to get the second one installed,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Thanks, again,” said Erik. “The sooner that’s done, the safer I’ll feel.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">“I need someone to do this job,” Erik had said, “at least until we figure out who’s the new leader.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I still think it should be you, by default. I don’t know why there has be a vote or anything,” Jo had muttered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If the Council doesn’t choose, you know there’ll be resentment, or worse,” Erik had cautioned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I know, I know,” there had been no objection Jo could offer. She had still hated the idea, but she couldn’t fault Erik for his logic. “There has to be someone else to do this, right? Like Bonnie! Bonnie’d be great at this!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Oh, no question,” Erik had agreed, “but who’d replace her? That’s a level of chaos I don’t want to see.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Dawn?” Jo had offered.</p>



<p>“Yes,” Erik had agreed grudgingly, “though the way she and Francis bicker, that’s going to make things harder to do. They make you and Carl look friendly.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“But…,” Jo had tried to think of all the people she knew handling administrative work. There weren’t many, and the others weren’t very good at it. “Why <em>me</em>? I’m supposed to be fixing things. The girders, remember?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’re the only one I trust,” Erik had said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And with that one statement, Jo had come to understand Erik’s true challenge. It was made even clearer when she’d entered the Council room.</p>



<p>“What is <em>she</em> doing here?” Carl demanded. Jo smiled to herself. She had fully expected him to be the first to object. It also gave her a certain amount of pleasure to be a thorn in his side.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’ve been handling Professor Batesworth’s work for the last couple of days, which means my work wasn’t being done,” explained Erik. “And since you so boldly stepped up to deal with roof repair,” Erik cast his version of a disapproving stare, “that left Jo a bit empty-handed. I had her handle my tasks until we can get people permanently reassigned.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That doesn’t give her the right to be here!” Carl protested. “She’s been <em>demoted</em>!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Jo’s here because she has the maintenance status,” Erik said calmly, sitting in his traditional seat. Jo took her old seat. Only Batesworth’s seat remained empty. “Or would you prefer us not have a proper scrum?” Carl offered no reply.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Good,” Erik nodded. “Now, then. Our population is down,” he looked to Batesworth’s chair, “by one. There have been no new births, no additional deaths. Radio signals are static. Jo?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo clasped her hands on her lap, they slid across each other with sweat. “The electrical situation appears to be stable, Dawn’s fixes seem to have done the trick. It appears that…,” she caught a look from Erik that suggested ‘don’t talk about that wire’, “It appears that the station has slid another two millimetres. We need to get those shackles in place very soon, or we’ll miss the window. We’ve got the new moulds into the workshop this morning. Any news when I can get those, Francis?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl and Francis exchanged a quick glance. “Yeah,” said Francis. “We’ll pour them today. Phil’s made the copes and drags for your brackets. The steel’s heating, but it’ll take a few hours to actually melt. With luck, they’ll be ready tomorrow. They won’t be ground or polished—”</p>



<p>Jo waved off any further comment. “Neither were the last ones. So long as they fit, I don’t care if they’re covered in burrs and bark at the moon.” Smiley laughed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Other maintenance issues?” Erik prompted, adding another look that said ‘you know’. Jo’s eyes widened for a second before her memory was jarred. “The work rotations are stable. Kelly’s seeing fewer tunnelling-related injuries, she says ‘thanks’, by the way. Food production is at its normal level, as well.”</p>



<p>“Thanks, Jo,” said Erik. “Smi—“</p>



<p>“The growers are a bit concerned about their new space in the tunnels. They’re wondering if they can get a tour?” Jo looked at Carl. Out of the corner of her eye, she say the glare from Erik that was clearly ‘we didn’t talk about that!’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re still wiring in there,” said Carl, not missing a beat. “It’s a bit dark right now, so they’ll have some trouble seeing. Rich had us focus on getting the residential areas ready first.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo nodded, but said nothing else.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Speaking of which,” said Erik, still glaring at Jo, “what’s the schedule for moving people in? We’ve already had some, but we’ve got a more to go.” He turned to Carl.</p>



<p>Carl and Smiley exchanged a non-verbal moment. “There’s a hundred already moved at the east end of Level 1,” said Smiley. “About a third of Level 1 rooms are ready. They’re a bit dark, though, so it’ll be hard for them at first.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We can move the lights from the ARCH when we move the people,” added Carl. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“And the toilets?” asked Erik.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’ll have one, for now,” said Carl. “We still need a tailings dump. We haven’t finished the dump slots on the upper levels yet.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>One</em> toilet for how many people?” Jo asked incredulously. Another glance from Erik.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“About four hundred,” said Smiley. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’ll need to keep using ARCH’s toilets for a while,” added Carl.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s not ideal,” Erik agreed, “but it’s fine for the short term. If we get the structure stabilized, we should be able to get at least another couple of months before the ARCH’s in serious danger?” Erik looked to Jo, without communicating anything else.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Assuming the girders hold, I think about a month. After that, I’m worried that something’s going to give,” Jo acknowledged.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Alright,” Erik puffed, and placed his hands on the table. “Francis, any updates from you?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Francis shook his head. “Just Jo’s shackles.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Alright, then,” said Erik. “We have a few shoes to fill. The first is Jo’s position on Council.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Why can’t Jo stay?” asked Smiley. “She’s good at what she does.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo turned sharply to her tablemate, unable to hide her joy. “Thank you, Smiley,” she beamed. Smiley tipped a non-existent hat at Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“She’s been stripped of her status,” Carl nearly barked. His frown could have toasted bread.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The tribunal decided that Jo was to be <em>suspended</em> from administrative duties,” Erik corrected, “which means she can be reinstated. Given the current circumstances I’m going to suggest that it’s an option we should consider. That said, we should also consider other <em>appropriate</em> candidates.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Bob,” Carl said quickly. Jo restrained her objection.</p>



<p>“Francis?” asked Erik. Carl’s eyes trained on his neighbor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Bob…,” Francis nodded slightly, “Bob’s got a decent skill. I think he’d be okay.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Bob’s a gofer!” spat Smiley, casting a brutal stare back at Carl. “He has only one opinion, and it ain’t his own.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So Bob’s out,” said Erik.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Hey! That’s two against one!” Carl protested. Erik looked back plainly, but said nothing. “Fine.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Anyone else?” asked Erik. “I would suggest Bonnie, but she said she didn’t want it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What about Phil?” asked Carl. There was an uncomfortable exchange of glances, and no-one said anything else.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Dawn?” suggested Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik looked thoughtful. “Yeah, she’d be a good—“</p>



<p>“NO WAY!” shouted Francis. “You bring her in, and you can forget about getting things from my shop!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Excuse me, <em>Frank</em>,” Erik annunciated clearly for effect. “That workshop and its contents are to support the ARCH. It is <em>not</em> your personal domain.”</p>



<p>“You bring my wife in here, and you’ll need an <em>army</em> to break down those doors,” Francis grumbled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’ll back Francis on that,” said Carl.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik sighed. “Alright, alright. You geniuses have anyone else?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Uncomfortable silence filled the room, and eyes moved from person to person like gnats. Lips were chewed, fingers were tapped.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Okay, in light of no other proposals, we need to consider Smiley’s suggestion. I move to restore Jo to her administrative roles,” said Erik and immediately held up his hand to silence Carl’s imminent outburst. “She’s got the experience and she’s doing the job right now. So unless you’ve got someone else we can all agree on, I think this is the most <em>logical</em> course of action.” He lowered his hand. “Now, objections?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Silence, again. Unlike before, it was a testy silence, the air filled with a electric gloom. Carl sulked in his chair, trying to think of a retort. Francis eyed Carl nervously. Smiley just smiled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In the absence of objections, Jo is restored. I’ll inform Agatha, as I’m sure she won’t like it,” said Erik. Carl pouted fiercely. “Now for the big one,” Erik motioned to Batesworth’s empty seat. “We need a new Council Chair.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Carl!” said Francis quickly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Erik!” said Jo just as quickly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Smiley just smiled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Look, Erik’s had the most experience with dealing with the administration. He’s been working next to Batesworth for years. He already knows the job. This is a no-brainer!” Jo argued.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Erik doesn’t break up fights very well,” said Carl. “He prefers everyone just shut up while he enforces his will.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That doesn’t sound familiar at all,” said Jo flippantly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What did you say?” Carl demanded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You <em>create</em> conflict, Carl!” Jo shot back. “Or are you oblivious to that? At least Erik aims for cooler heads before assessing the problem <em>objectively</em>.”</p>



<p>“You’re his puppet,” Carl sneered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I trust his advice and his decisions. He earned my trust a long time ago. Which is a far cry from anything I have for you,” Jo said quietly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Can I suggest something?” Smiley asked. Carl stopped in his pre-blowout windup and looked at Smiley curiously.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Carl’s a good tunnel manager. He’s dealt with our problems and now we’re able to take people in. But we can’t take everyone. We got a lot left still to do. If you took the top job, Carl, who would take yours? Who would deal with the projects?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“He’s right, Carl,” said Francis, turning to Carl. “Think of the future. We’ll be better off.” Francis added a look that no-one would mistake as ‘you know’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl fought with himself. It almost looked like he would tear himself in two. Finally, he clasped his hands calmly and placed them on the table. “Fine,” he said. “I… I <em>concede</em> the Chair to Erik.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo clapped softly, and was joined by Smiley. Francis clapped a few times awkwardly. Carl merely nodded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik stood. “Thank you.” He moved apprehensively one seat over, and sat gingerly. “I will not take this appointment lightly.” He straightened, and for a moment sat as rigidly as Batesworth ever had. “That now means we need to backfill another spot: my old one.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Jo,” Carl blurted. “Without question. She knows it better than anyone, so you said yourself.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Jo,” agreed Francis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Smiley nodded absently, but also said: “Jo.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik looked at Jo. “Well, that’s a fair bit of support,” he said. “What do you think?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Well, I’d kind of like to finish the work I was doing,” said Jo. She looked nervously at Carl and Francis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Let’s start a transition, then,” said Erik. “Finish up the girder work, get someone else down there to work with you and Donner, and then you’ll move to my old desk.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Okay,” said Jo quietly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“And Jo’s replacement?” asked Carl.</p>



<p>“Well, I’d suggest Dawn, but I since Francis is against it…,” Jo looked at Francis, whose angry nods confirmed his stance, “maybe we can look at…,” Jo cringed at the thought, “Phil?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“He’s not quite as bright as you,” admitted Erik, “but he seems to have a good understanding of things. He’s also good with working with his hands. But that requires him to leave Francis’ team.” Erik looked to Francis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Francis sighed. The thought weighed on him, as did Carl’s demanding countenance. Finally, he nodded. “Yeah, okay. On one condition: I can take Donner. That kid seems pretty smart. Even Dawn talks about him.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo’s face fell. “But he’s really good with fixing things! If we lose him from maintenance—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re starting to move into the tunnels,” said Carl. “And if your repairs hold, we won’t need the maintenance as desperately. We need people to make shielding and wires and tools so we can finish getting people in the tunnels. If Donner’s as good as you say he is, that’ll just make things move faster.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was Jo’s turn to be weighed down with thoughts. It felt like a pebble in her sock, dancing around her toes as she walked. She shook the pebble loose. “Okay,” she admitted. “But only after the girders are in place.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Agreed,” said Erik. “The girders take precedence. Once those are in place, we can shuffle everyone around. Jo, you and I will split the senior coordinator duties until then.” Jo nodded. “Alright, that’s the agenda. Anything else we need to discuss?” Everyone shook their heads. “Let’s get to it.” Everyone stood and headed for the door. “Jo, let’s quickly look over the assignments? You’ve got a while until you can use the shackles, anyway.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik waited until everyone was gone. “Thank you for not going off on Carl today.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It wasn’t easy,” said Jo. She studied his face. “You planned that, didn’t you?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Planned what?” Erik asked innocently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Getting me back on Council,” she said with a smile. “And getting me into your seat.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I need someone I can trust, Jo,” he said. “And frankly, having you around will make this a lot more bearable.” He blushed slightly, looked at the floor and jiggled his hand. “And, yes, I planned that. Getting your vote on Council was important. I knew Carl would put up a fight for the Chair.”</p>



<p>“But he didn’t, really,” said Jo. “That kind of scares me.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Me, too,” said Erik quietly. “He’s eyed Chair for a long time. He had the opportunity and the table was loaded in his favour. How did Smiley talk him down so easily?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They must have talked about something before. Smiley put the gears to him.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik humphed. “Smiley. He’s not the type to do that.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Something’s going on in those tunnels, Erik. More than just digging.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Like what?” asked Erik. “Unless they’re cloning people and making their own army, I don’t know what they could be doing that would be that suspicious.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah, I don’t know, either,” Jo said.</p>



<p>Erik studied Jo. “What aren’t you telling me?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo remained quiet a few moments. “You don’t want to know. Not yet. There’s that term, for when someone can actually say they don’t know?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Plausible deniability.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That. You don’t want to know. Not yet.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Do <em>you</em> know?” asked Erik.</p>



<p>“I … maybe. I’m not sure. I’ve … I have my … thoughts.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’re being strangely unaccusatory,” Erik commented. “Why? What’s going on.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’re now the one in charge, cariño. Someone has to keep an eye on your safety.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You think I’m in danger?”</p>



<p>“We all are.”</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Jo woke up. She had <em>slept</em>, for the second time in as many weeks. She rose from her cramped cot, the springs squeaking and squealing as she rose to sitting, adding short bursts of noise as she pulled on her clothes. She could near snoring in the room beyond. Many had slept, were still sleeping, on a few were awake and whispering nervously. She tiptoed gently through the room and into the hall, attracting a few glances from the awake.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The only sound was slumber. There wasn’t so much as a whiff of wind. It was dead silent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo decided to walk through the atrium, instead of taking the adjacent hallways, to get to the Engineers office. The atmosphere of the atrium should have been easy, taking a break from the bedlam; instead it was strung tight as it strived for silence, mortifed to make a single sound. The periodic cough was stifled. People walked on their toes. Even accidental clanks elicited surprised and terrified looks from those around. Those awake looked up towards the ceiling as if it would suddenly open and drop the universe upon them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Few moved, preferring to stay in their positions. This made getting through the atrium errantly easy. Jo didn’t so much as bump into a single person, where normally she was using her elbow as a spear to force the wall of bodies apart. A few looked up, as if to ask what was wrong, hoping for some semblance of assurance. Jo smiled tersely as she passed them, having nothing else worth offering.</p>



<p>Unlike every previous instance of dead calm that Jo could remember, the Engineer’s Office was devoid of people, except for Erik. He looked as uneasy as Jo felt as she crept through the door.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Where is everyone?” she asked, immediately sensing the loudness of her voice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Good <em>afternoon</em>,” he smirked. “You look rested.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I feel awake, yeah,” she nodded. “You feel as weird about this as I do?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik tapped his fingers on the desk. “Weirder. Every time there’s been a break, people are here looking for something to do outside. You’re the first one to come through the door.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Maybe the last time scared everyone off,” Jo said quietly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Maybe.” Erik didn’t sound convinced. “Maybe they’re all still sleeping. Either way, work still has to be done. I’d send people back out to check that roof panel, if anyone was available. Or maybe out into the valley to find more wood — we used almost all of it at Batesworth’s funeral.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Well, I could go to the roof,” Jo offered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Nuh uh,” Erik shook his head. “Francis told me that your shackles are ready. That’s your priority, we need that done.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Okay,” smiled Jo. “I could use an extra hand or three…?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’ve got Donner. Get Phil to join you, so he gets a feel for handling this on a regular basis. I’ll hold the fort today.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Thanks, Erik,” smiled Jo. She lingered a couple of moments.</p>



<p>Erik lingered at his desk a moment, then got up and walked over to her. “You okay?” he asked gently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s … I think so,” she smiled awkwardly. “So much is … different. Right now, that is. I mean, it’s silent, but we’re not doing what we should be doing when the winds are down, and … it seems okay. Rich is gone, Robert’s gone. You’re in charge. I’m … me, supongo.” She looked up to Erik, who placed a hand on her shoulder, close to her neck. She rested her cheek on Erik’s hand and closed her eyes. “It’s a lot of change. It’s … weird.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Years of doing the same thing every day are hard to break,” he said. He leaned in closer. “Are you okay?” She could feel his breath on her ear and neck.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Sí. Estaré bien, cariño.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Are you ever going to tell me what that means?” he laughed.</p>



<p>Jo twisted her head further and kissed his hand, then stepped towards the door. “Maybe,” she winked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Go on,” he said. “We can talk more later.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo wound her way down to the reservoir to look at the struts. The string showed that nothing had moved. She glanced over to the edge of the wall and saw Donner, still asleep. She poked him with his foot, snapping him from a dream so suddenly that his head hit the wall as he flinched.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“OW!”</p>



<p>“Disculpame, Donner,” said Jo. “Vamos, we need to get started.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Can we eat first?” asked Donner. “I’m starving.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yo también. But we need to get this in before the winds come back,” Jo looked up to the ceiling. “Let’s get the shackles. ¡Vamos!”</p>

<p>Phil had been waiting for Jo and Donner in the workshop. He was brushing off some of the sharper edges of the still-warm shackles. “I was wondering when you’d show up!” he grinned. “I was about to bring them down myself, but…”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The shackles were heavy, possible for a single person to carry with stops, two could carry much more easily. The pins were less massive, though heavy enough that you didn’t want to drop one on your foot. One by one, the three of them picked up a shackle or a pin, and began to haul the materials down to the reservoir. It took three trips to carry it all, including the rock bolts and fasteners; the rest of the equipment was already waiting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As had been done before, Jo and Phil lifted the heavy shackle up the wall, and Donner slid in the rock bolt to hold it in place so that the other bolts could be slid in. Phil then took the job of turning the bolts in with the long-handled wrench. The first bolt went in with a fair amount of ease, as did the next two, all three going in only tight enough to keep the shackle from falling out under its own weight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fourth bolt, on the top-right corner, got caught barely a third of the way in. “Can’t move it!” said Phil, having cranked the gooseneck quite a way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Back it out, Phil, something’s wrong,” said Jo. “I don’t want to—“ There was loud bang and Phil fell to the ground, the bolt wrench landing on him. All three looked at the bolt and saw only a short length of the shaft coming from the hole. “Mierda.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It snapped!” exclaimed Donner. He looked closely at the end of the bolt, the surface a spiral slope. “What happened?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo took the bolt and showed it to Phil, who took it and scrutinized the metal at the end. “Son of a bitch!” He looked at Jo. “Sorry.” She shrugged off the comment. “This wasn’t properly melted, there’s too much g—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Gold?” said Jo as she looked closer. The metal had dozens of shiny yellowy fragments. “That’s gold, isn’t it?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah,” Phil admitted slowly.</p>



<p>“There’s some in that shackle, too,” said Donner, pointing at the first mount they’d attached to the wall. “What’s gold doing in the steel?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Una buena pregunta, Donner.” Jo looked at Phil. “Why is there gold in the steel, Phil?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phil avoided Jo’s gaze. “We’re … they found gold in one of the tunnels,” he said quickly. “We’ve been smelting it into—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Discs, I know,” said Jo. “You’re making wire, right?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phil looked up. “You <em>know</em>?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I found it in your storage. Lots of it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How did you…?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I was looking for the electrical panel,” said Jo, crouching down to Phil, who was still seated. “I wanted to know what happened to Rich,” she said more quietly. She took a breath before continuing. “While I was looking for it, I found the boxes full of gold discs. You know that it’s easier to draw wire from cylinders, right? That was part of Pranha’s materials course.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phil blinked and stammered a moment, then shook off the questions. “Yeah, I know,” he said. “Look, we’ve been smelting. We tried to get all the previous smelt out, but… obviously, we didn’t.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Can we weld the end of the bolt back on?” asked Donner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phil shook his head. “It won’t be strong enough. Besides, we don’t have anything hot enough we can bring down here.” He looked at the stumped bolt. “We’ve got to back that out.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re going to have to back all of them out,” said Jo.</p>



<p>“This job sucks,” said Donner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Jo and Donner gingerly backed out the three installed bolts, Phil inspected the remaining two bolts for flaws, then went back to the workshop for a replacement and some additional tools to try remove the broken bolt. He returned with a pair of pliers that would have been fitting for pulling thorns from a dragon’s foot. It took the three of them to clamp down on the bolt and wrap the handles with a strong strap. With the mallet, they took turns swinging at the massive plier’s handle to slowly start working the bolt out. The bolt seemed quite comfortable in its home and steadfastly refused eviction. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Suddenly, the pliers slipped free and hit the ground. “Dammit,” said Phil. He looked at the end of the bolt, covered with fresh, shiny scrapes. “We’re going to have to get this on even tighter.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If only a come along would fit,” muttered Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We could improvise one?” suggested Donner. Both Jo and Phil looked at the young man. “Uh, like this!” He picked up the pliers and removed the limp strap, put the pliers back on the bolt and handed the handles to Phil. He then rewrapped the strap, tying a loop, with a bit of slack. He then took an unused rock bolt and slipped it inside the strap loop, and started twisting. The strap tightened quickly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phil looked in amazement. “Huh. That’s really, smart, kid.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“He’s full of this stuff,” smiled Jo. “We’ll twist, you hit, Phil. Just don’t hit us.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The plier’s teeth dug into the bolt, the handles bent slightly under the pull, the strap groaned under the stress. Carefully, Phil malleted at the handles, the shock going up the bolt to Jo and Donner’s hands as they tried to keep the strap tight. Phil hit again and the pliers fell towards the ground again, this time with the head still attached to the bolt. They undid the strap and used the pliers to remove the rest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That end is <em>mangled</em>,” said Phil, looking at the bolt. “I thought you drilled it all out?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I thought we did, too,” said Jo. “There must be a hard rock right at the edge. We can’t move the holes. We’ll have to be careful on this one.”&nbsp;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>The atrium was still uncomfortably quiet, a dreadful anticipation hung over the space like the tranquil eye of a hurricane. People watched the ceiling, the roof, the walls, and each other. They strained for any sign of something about to go wrong, to attack. Which is why they all jumped and yelped when the first pin that secured the girder to the struts that ran up into the atrium started to be hammered into place. The noise was sharp, piercing, and reverberated through the entire structure, splitting off horrid harmonics at every joint. Curiously, after several moments, the atrium’s liveliness picked up, as the silence had been shoved away.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the second girder in place, Jo, Phil, and Donner, rested against the reservoir’s cool concrete wall. They drank heavily from their water bottles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m going to feel this in the morning,” groaned Phil.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Get used to it, Phil, it doesn’t get any easier,” chuckled Jo.</p>



<p>Phil snorted. “You <em>do</em> know I spend most of my day forging and hammering things, right?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m kidding, Phil,” Jo smirked. “Believe me, this is way worse than most of the stuff I’ve had to deal with over the last couple of years.” She gulped another mouthful. “It’s good to have you here.”</p>



<p>They drank again. The only sound was their swallowing. They could scarcely hear the growers talking as they picked food in the greenhouse, many yards away. There was a low mumbling, which was the remnants of conversation from the atrium, having seeped through the levels above.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I hate it when it’s this quiet,” said Jo. “I feel like we need to make noise just to make up for the winds.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Hey, when it’s this quiet, that means no-one’s dying, right?” said Phil.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah,” said Donner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“She’s always angrier afterwards,” said Jo nervously. “It’s always worse.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I just hope we don’t piss her off with all this banging,” said Phil. “D’ya think she can hear us?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Probably,” said Donner. “This has got to be resonating up to the roof.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Oh, it is,” Jo acknowledged.</p>



<p>“At least it’s done,” said Phil. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah, these tools weren’t going to last much longer. Especially the drill and bits. They’ve taken a beating on this job,” said Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How dull is it now?” asked Phil. He looked at the bit, still sitting in the drill. The chisel’s point had been rounded out and looked painfully dull.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We might be able to get one last sharpen out of that,” Phil suggested. “Maybe. There’s not much left.”</p>



<p>Jo moaned softly. “We’re running out of good tools. Running out of parts. Running out of luck.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“C’mon, Jo, we’re not that bad off,” Phil countered lightly. “It’s not easy, but we can make new bits. They just won’t be as good as the old ones, we can’t make high-carbon steel. Look on the bright side, we’ll soon have this place to scrounge for parts! What isn’t useable as a part can be melted down into something new. We’ll have so much we won’t know what to do with it all!” Phil was smiling contentedly. “It won’t be perfect, but it’ll be good. It’s a golden future, Jo. You just need a little more faith.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah, maybe,” said Jo. “I’m probably just letting things get to me. I just can’t help shake this feeling … I dunno, maybe I’m sad about all of this?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“About what?” asked Donner. “Because the Professor died?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No…, well, actually, I guess ‘yes’, but not just that,” Jo rolled the ideas around in her head a moment. “I think I’m sad to leave this,” she said, throwing her arms out to the air. “I mean, we <em>built</em> this place. This place is a love child of Buckminster Fuller and Mary Shelley. It supports <em>thousands</em> of people. Think about that. This place is huge. There’s football stadiums that aren’t this large. This is the sort of thing that ends up in Guinness!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Under what category? ‘Largest Potential Deathtrap’?” Phil chuckled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“‘World’s Largest Fallout Shelter’!” Donner added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You guys don’t feel any attachment to this?” Jo asked. Both of them shook their heads. “Nothing? This place is <em>impressive</em>, when you think about it. Okay, yes, it’s a hodgepodge of designs, but they all work together. And considering almost everything is scavenged and rebuilt from something else, we did a pretty good job with the structure and mechanices. Generations from now, our descendants will talk about it like people talk about Noah’s Ark.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This place?” asked Phil dubiously. “I dunno. Maybe more like … a old hospital that had outlived its usefulness. No-one cries when they’re torn down.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phil’s use of the present tense for things that had become distant history felt like a burning stab. The world didn’t exist beyond their little valley. “Unless you’re the one trying to keep people healthy,” said Jo. “This place <em>feels</em>, you know. Taking care of this place is like taking care of a sick friend. You worry about it, you want them to get healthy. You want to see them come back to life, to run and play.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s a <em>building</em>, Jo. You remember what the Professor says: ‘All buildings fall’,” said Phil.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah,” she said quietly. “Well, this building isn’t falling on my watch,” she grunted, getting back up. “Oh, I almost forgot,” sighed Jo. “Donner, you’re being reassigned to the workshop. You’re going to be working with Francis, now.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I am?” Donner asked sadly. “But… I thought…”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re done. We’re all being reassigned,” said Jo. “Phil’s taking over as head of maintenance.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I am?” asked Phil.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Francis didn’t tell you?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I haven’t seen him,” he said.</p>



<p>“Ah. Well, you’re being promoted. Donner’s taking your old job.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Oh,” Phil and Donner said simultaneously.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo shrugged. “It’s a new world, guys. Get used to change, I guess.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>They picked up the remaining tools, slung whatever they could wherever it would stay, and headed back to the workshop.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>A note to the reader: This is a particular long chapter.</em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Oh, and it has explicit sex. </em></p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The first shift bell had rung as Jo headed towards the Engineer’s Office. Once upon a time, she had recognized ‘first shift’ as ‘midnight’, but somewhere along the way, they’d all forgotten about the time on a clock.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The hallway was quiet, the Office was still open, with the sole light being on in Erik’s newly-inherited room. The Office was otherwise empty. Erik was staring at a small pile of chalkboards, flipping between them in a robotic manner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo rapped on the doorframe. “Hey.” Erik jolted, dropping two of the blackboards. “Disculpame.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No, it’s okay,” he muttered and picked them up. One of them had smudged crossing over his leg. He twisted it around to see if made any more sense. “Oh well,” he sighed, and tossed it back onto the floor, in a pile of similar boards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You look stressed,” said Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I always wondered how Rich did this every day,” said Erik, slumping into the chair. He motioned for Jo to come in. She plopped into one of the three utterly mismatched and threadbare chairs in front of the desk. “Today, I think I figured it out.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Oh? What was his secret?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik shook his head in disbelief. “I’m pretty sure he just tuned people out. He picked up the key words, proselytized, and sent them on their way. It’s the only way I can see him having put up with this bullshit day after day.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Are you going to try that tomorrow?” Jo smirked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m tempted to try it now,” Erik mock-sneered in return. “You look like you’ve had quite the day, too.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s done,” Jo cheered half-heartedly. “Thanks to Phil, we got all the brackets in and the girders pinned. It should keep the bend in the structure steady for a while.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik leaned forward. “How long, do you think?” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo let out a strained sigh. “I dunno. We don’t have any of measuring the load, so it’s hard to know how much tension everything is under. For all I know, one of those girders could snap tomorrow, and <em>boom</em>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You put it all together, so I have faith it’ll hold more than long enough. And probably a lot longer, once we get all these people out of here. That alone will remove over eight hundred tons of mass on the structure. Who knows, the ARCH could last another decade.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If we don’t tear it to shreds, first,” she countered, “which we will. We’ll gut this place for every bit of value we can.”</p>



<p>Erik nodded. “True. It’ll be sad to see her go.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo threw her hands up. “¡Finalmente! Someone who agrees with me!” She looked at Erik. “Are we too attached?” she asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik blinked at the question. “Attached to … each other?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo blinked at the question. “The ARCH,” she said unsuredly&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Oh, yeah,” he stammered. “Yeah, I think we are. But you were the star student: you took everything seriously and passionately. Rich always said you were the best one he had.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Really?” she asked quietly. “I mean, like, <em>really</em>? You’re not just saying that?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik held up a Scout’s salute. “If I’m lyin’, I’m dyin’!”</p>



<p>“I never knew that,” she said. “He never mentioned it in any reviews.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You know Rich. He never said what he really felt. Sometimes I think he was so cold that he could have refrigerated this place.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Too bad,” Jo murmured. “Ice cubes would’ve been nice to have.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik burst out laughing. “While you’re at it, wish for some fine scotch!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I never liked scotch. The flavor was too strong.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You were a shots girl, weren’t you?” Erik grinned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah, you know that!” she exclaimed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I do?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“¡Dios mío!” Jo feigned shock. “You don’t remember that joint in Page?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Page,” Erik repeated. “Page … Page … I remember a night when we all went to Page. Some idiot suggested we do a bar crawl.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Me,” said Jo proudly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I remember the second place, some country and western roadhouse, right?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Tsk, tsk,” Jo tutted. “That was the <em>first</em> place.”</p>



<p>“What?!” Erik blurted. “No way!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think you downed four shots of tequila in about ten minutes. I thought you were going to pass out before we left.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Tequila?” he asked. Erik got up from his new desk and walked out to his old desk.</p>



<p>“I think that’s what got you up on stage for karaoke,” Jo continued. “You do a pretty decent <em>Crocodile Rock</em>, y’know…”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik dug out a key and unlocked one of the drawers. He rummaged around for a moment and Jo heard the distinct sound of a full glass bottle hitting a smaller glass object. Erik returned a moment later with a squarish bottle containing a dark amber liquid. He slapped down a shot glass in front of Jo on the desk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo felt her jaw drop. “Is that … ¿¡añejo?!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Sí,” Erik replied in his very best Spanish accent. “I brought this with me to celebrate our last night at the ARCH before returning to class. I almost forgot I had this in the drawer.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo stared at the bottle, not noticing that she had almost salivated onto the floor. “And what is this occasion?”</p>



<p>Erik twisted the glass cap until it popped free and poured into the glass. He plunked down a second glass in front of him and poured again. “Well, I could go with celebrating you saving our asses again, but that’s getting kind of old, don’t you think?” he winked. “How about … to Professor Batesworth. Without him, we’d all be dead right now.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’ll give you that his course took us away. But we saved ourselves.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Er, okay,” Erik nodded. “What, then?”</p>



<p>Jo popped up to standing. “A nuestros amados muertos,” she said, holding up her glass. We smiled at Erik. “To our beloved departed.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik stood and matched her stance. “Our beloved departed.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>They each nodded and threw the contents back in a single motion. Erik was the first to cough, followed by Jo a moment later. Both of them steadied themselves on the desk, clearing their throats.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Wow,” Jo said hoarsely.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Wow,” Erik echoed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How old is that?” Jo asked, picking up the bottle. “¡Dios mío! This is nearly twenty years old!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Is that why it burns so much?” Erik gasped.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No, cariño,” said Jo, pouring two more glasses, “that is because we haven’t had a drop of booze in a decade. By the third shot, you’ll see why this stuff is like gold!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>Third</em> shot? I thought we were just having one?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Oh, come on, you can’t put this out and not expect to have at least a couple of drinks!” Jo pleaded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik grimaced. “Alright.” He poured out again and picked up his glass. “What are we drinking to this time?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo held her glass aloft. She cleared her throat again, though more for drama than any biological need, and said as clearly as she could: “We are Engineers. In our profession we take deep pride. To it we owe solemn obligations. Since the Stone Age, Human Progress has been spurred by the Engineering Genius. Engineers have made usable Nature&#8217;s vast resources of Materials and Energy for Humanity&#8217;s Benefit. Engineers have vitalized and turned to practical use the Principles of Science and the Means of Technology. Were it not for this heritage of accumulated experiences, our efforts would be feeble. As an engineer, we pledge to practice Integrity and Fair Dealing, Tolerance, and Respect, and to uphold devotion to the standards and dignity of our profession, conscious always that our skill carries with it the obligation to serve humanity by making best use of the Earth&#8217;s precious wealth. As an engineer, we shall participate in none but honest enterprises. When needed, our skill and knowledge shall be given without reservation for the public good. In the performance of duty, and in fidelity to our profession, we shall give the utmost.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik whistled. “Impressive. I completely screwed up the Pledge. Oh, and you got the plurality wrong — it’s supposed to be ‘I’, not ‘we’, but otherwise you nailed it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I was referring to us. You and me. ‘We’,” she grinned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I got that.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Drink.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The shots went back as quickly as the first.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ohhhhh,” sighed Jo, her head tilted back. “Maldito that’s good,” she purred.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik stared at his glass, then looked at Jo. “It is?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Really, chico? Why did you buy that if you don’t even like it?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Well, I… um, well, I thought that…”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You thought the chicas would dig a guy with good hooch?” Jo smirked. Erik blushed and shrugged. “Well, I do. A lot. Thanks for the booze,” she smiled. “Hopefully that’ll keep my shoulders from rebelling in the morning.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Long for power tools, huh?” Erik commented. Jo levelled a knowing stare. “Oh, uh, that’s not… I meant drills, I mean, what I meant—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo walked over to Erik, and gave him a kiss on the cheek. “You’re too uptight, Erik. You should drink more of that,” she said. “Sleep well. I’ll see you in the morning.” She turned to the door, and bent to the side. There was an audible pop in her shoulder. “Oh, yeah, I’m definitely gonna feel that in the morning.” She rolled the shoulder as she headed to the door.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Er, uh, Jo?”</p>



<p>Jo stopped and turned. “Mmm?” &nbsp;</p>



<p>“I, uh, I can rub that out for you. Y’know, if you want.” Erik blushed again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Really? That’s awfully sweet of you,” she smiled. “But I doubt those little office fingers of yours can make a dent in this mess.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I dunno,” Erik said. “Rich was a regular customer. And I assure you, his back was a nightmare.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo eyed Erik for a few moments. “Alright, let’s see what you can do.” As she walked back into the room, Erik flipped a chair without armrests around, and motioned Jo to sit. She straddled it backwards, her chest pressing into the seat back, her arms hung loose at her sides. She felt his hands resting on her shoulders, pressing lightly at first, but then squeezing through her shirt, stretching out her trapezius.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was a double-hit of intense pain, the muscles having been held under tension for so long, and a massive rush of endorphins as Erik’s deft fingers snapped things back into places they hadn’t been for a long time. Jo let out a low staccato growl.</p>



<p>Erik’s hands stopped. “You okay? Did I hurt you?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Más. Por favor.” Jo tried not to beg too hard. “This hurts, but it feels soooo good.”</p>



<p>“You haven’t had a good rub down in a long time,” said Erik, as he felt around her shoulder blades.</p>



<p>Jo laughed, though when combined with her body’s reaction to the massage, came out more of a yelp. “I’ve been a bit busy…” Erik found a nexus of tightness and pressed the pad of his thumb in a tight swirl. There was almost a popping, and Jo’s shoulder twitched and went slack. This time she shrieked, which quickly dropped off to a relieved and contented, almost guttural sigh, and she stretched out further in the chair. “That,” she whispered. “Do that again.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Those girders really did a number on you,” Erik commented as he pressed into more of Jo’s upper back. He ran a thumb down both sides of Jo’s spine. She shivered and hummed. “Hey, I thought of something for your tension problem.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think you’re <em>doing</em> something for my tension problem,” she said warmly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I meant your girders. You could put in a tension gauge.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Hmm,” Jo hmm’ed absently. “You’re thinking too much…”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No, really. All you need is an oil-filled cylinder with a pressure gauge, and a long rod. Attach them at opposite ends. If the gauge shows a change…”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So, you’re suggesting I insert a <em>long rod</em> into a <em>cylinder</em> to worry less?” she asked slyly. “I take that back… I’m beginning to like how you’re thinking.”</p>



<p>“Uh…,” Erik’s voice wavered. He found another knot just under the edge of Jo’s scapula. He dug his fingertips in, and slowly untangled the twists.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ohhhhhhh,” Jo moaned softly. “Where did you learn to do this?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“My ex, actually. She was a massage therapist.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I envy her,” Jo grunted as Erik twanged one of her levators. “Ow!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Oops, sorry,” said Erik. “Actually, she hated getting massages. Go figure. But Rich liked them. I think that’s how I got to be his TA.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Huh, and here I thought it was sexual favors.” Erik intentionally pinched her shoulder. “OW!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah, well, being his TA wasn’t any fun, let me tell you. He was patronizing, demanding, he expected you to know his thoughts, and being his TA meant I had to know more than all his undergrads,” he muttered. “You have any idea how hard it is to know more than all of you? I was a terrible student, so I had to study all the time. I think my only saving grace was that I was better than most at keeping all you kids ordered and in line.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah,” Jo groaned as Erik smoothed out her rhomboideus. “You were Mr. Organization. We all knew that. That’s what we liked about you. And you weren’t a polla about it, like Jeff.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You … you saw that?” he asked. “I thought I’d kept that a secret,” he lamented.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo giggled. “Eres adorable cuando usted actúa inocente.”</p>



<p>Erik rubbed her shoulders softly and leaned in behind her. His hands trembled. “Usted es bella cuando usted es condescendientes.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo turned slowly and looked at Erik. Her smile curled at the edges, her lips fuller than normal. “I think we need another drink, cariño. And between us, it’s ‘tu’, not ‘usted’.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik looked back down at Jo. He went to the bottle, poured out two more glasses, and handed one to Jo. His hand shook. “I know what ‘cariño’ means,” he said with a bit of warble.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Good,” Jo smiled demurely. “So what are drinking to?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik held up his glass, opened his mouth … “Uh…” He stared at the wall. “Um…”</p>



<p>Jo stood and came to him. “A nosotros,” she said, and clinked his glass.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah, I … I like that,” he said softly, with a slight smile. They drank without breaking eye contact. “Another?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo leaned in closely, brushing his beard with her cheek, and whispered into his ear. “Por favor.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik reached around behind him, fumbling across the desk for the bottle, unwilling to look away. “You were right.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“About?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The, uh, tequila,” he said, wrapping his hand around the bottle’s neck. He raised it to pour into Jo’s glass. “It does taste pretty good.” The bottle shook so terribly that he splashed the liquor over Jo’s hand and onto her sleeve. “Shit!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Here,” said Jo, and gently took the bottle and Erik’s glass. She poured the glasses and handed his back. “It’s a shame we don’t have any lime or salt.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah?” Erik’s hand shook so badly he started to spill.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ever done body shots?” she winked. Erik gulped and nearly spilled his drink. Jo took his hand in hers. “¿Nervioso?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“S-sí.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“¿Porque, cariño? No te voy a morder … duro.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo stepped closer to Erik. Still holding his hand, which held the glass, she tipped it up to his mouth. Even with her steadying hold, some dribbled onto his cheek, down into his beard, and down onto his neck. Jo grinned deviously, leaned in, and nuzzled the base of his neck where it met his shoulder. She felt his carotid artery pulse rapidly. She inhaled deeply. He gasped when she then extended her tongue and gently licked away the liquid.</p>



<p>Backing away, she studied Erik’s appearance, his face caught somewhere between ecstasy and shock. “You’re due for a shower,” she remarked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Y-yeah,” he stammered. “S-sorry. I’m n-not due until t-t-tomorrow.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m not scheduled for a few more days. I’m probably worse,” she sighed. “This tired body needs a wash.” She stretched it slowly out in front of him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I-it’s too b-bad we d-don’t let p-people shower t-together,” Erik tried to smile, only his face kept trying to spasm. “Y-y’know, save w-water?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo slugged back her shot and put down the bottle and glasses. She draped her hands around Erik’s shoulders and came a hand span away from him. She could feel his body vibrating. “I’d like that,” she whispered. “You’d make a great back scrubber.” She leaned in and pressed her lips against his. It was soft and simple, just enough movement to register it as more than a friendly action. After a few breaths, she pulled away. The kiss hadn’t calmed Erik’s excitement. He shook nearly everywhere.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’ve wanted to do that for a long time,” she said softly. She wanted to see past his hazel eyes, but they were too caught up in the mass panic of hormones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik stuttered, wrestling with himself to say anything. “R-really?”</p>



<p>“You never noticed?” she asked. “You honestly thought I needed your help for those assignments in 382?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I-I was your T-TA,” he shook.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She held his hand to his face and shh’ed softly. “Ya no.” She kissed him again, drawing him in tightly, her hand behind his head. Slowly and abruptly, she could feel Erik’s hands around her waist. She felt a sigh come from a place she’d worried long dead. Her jaw moved, his moved to match. It was harder, more powerful, even a little desperate. His whiskers danced across her lips, releasing tiny jolts with each tickle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo could feel herself fall, that wonderful sense when you let go of your fears and worries, when you leap for the moment to sink like a stone, surrounded by all the emotions and desires you’ve kept locked away for so long. She longed to be lost in the flood, wanting nothing more than the moment to be eternal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik broke away first. Jo tried to follow. “I don’t know,” he panted. “I’m … Chair,” he continued, “we shouldn’t … what will the others think?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo’s expression was bordering on bliss. She reached up and gently touched his lips with her fingers, brushed at his beard. His eyes had stopped their rapid jiggling. She took his hand in her other one, it had stopped shaking. Her eyes were soft. She felt younger than she had in years. “They’ll be jealous.” She cupped her hand behind his head and drew them together again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was deep, passionate. The feeling of a decade of pondering and planning and secret promises all blooming at once was enough to send tears streaming from the corners of both of her eyes. <em>This. Please, this.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik’s mouth moved from her lips, slowly across her chin, and towards her neck. Jo raised her head, allowing Erik access to the once-soft and tanned front, now pale and scarred. She forgot about the hundreds of tiny sand scratches, the wounds from flying bits of whatever that had been caught in the wind. All the mattered were his lips, soft and warm, tracing down under her chin, nuzzling and pulling at her flesh. She let her head hang back, her eyes closed dreamily.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik had to stoop slightly, being a bit taller than Jo, and dropped his hands to her hips as he traced the outline of her larynx with his mouth. Jo released a deep sigh, and let her hands drag lightly across his shoulders. She could feel his muscles moving under his shirt. She felt like she should be purring.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coming to Jo’s clavicle, Erik began to follow it out to her shoulder. He twisted slowly behind her, kissing over the top of her shoulder, until he returned to her neck. With one hand, he gently pulled Jo’s long hair over her shoulder, exposing the nape. He brushed it with his nose, and again with his beard. Jo shivered again. He placed his lips into the space just under the back of her ear, and resumed his gentle and slow movement. He could feel Jo’s pulse racing, her muscles trembling. He wrapped his arms around her waist. Jo lazily positioned her head so Erik could easily move up and down her neck. She then moved her head around to the other side, Erik following suit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She reached down and clasped her hands over his. She squeezed them gently, and rubbed her fingers between the ridges of his knuckles. Then she picked one of them up, and drew it up to her breast. Erik didn’t resist, and cupped her bosom. Jo suddenly wished she hadn’t been wearing her ancient sports bra. Even with the confinement, her nipple stiffened and pressed against Erik’s fingers through the fabric. He squeezed gently between two fingers, she gasped. She reached for his other hand and moved it to her other breast.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She started to want to cry out, to embrace the euphoria. But she was only beginning. Tingles ran from her neck to her waist, her breasts swelled, her groin flushed, her knees wanted to wobble. Her breaths were shallowing, her urges rising. She reached behind her, finding Erik’s thighs. She stroked the rough, thinning fabric, slipping her hands behind and pulling him in tighter. She felt the stiffening bulge in the cleft of her bum. She rocked her hips gently as she pulled, eliciting a soft grunt from Erik.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She took his hands, and moved them together over her chest, intertwined his fingers with hers, and undid a button on her shirt. She moved them down to the next button, and the next. Erik unbuttoned the rest without further prompting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo took a couple of steps forward. As she did, Erik pulled back on the shirt. The pale blue fabric slid effortlessly over Jo’s shoulders and dropped to the floor. Her black bra had lost some of its spring through years of wear, but still hugged her slim torso. She turned, sliding her feet out of her boots in the same motion, and with her hands clasped behind her back, picked up the shirt with her toes and flung it to the side. She sauntered back, her hips writhing side to side. Erik’s face was a bright red, burning through his beard, and she could feel his heat as she leaned up to kiss him again. As she did, she started to undo his shirt, from the bottom up. With the top button undone, she slowly spread her hands over his muscular shoulders, and pushed the shirt off.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Underneath was a tangle of darker blond hair, sowed with a few grey ones. She ran her fingers down his chest, letting the curly strands drift over her skin. She slowly wrapped her hands over his side, and pulled herself closer again. His warm skin pressing against hers felt divine, she could feel the ripples of the taut muscles in his back easily. She felt his hands caressing the small of her back, brushing over the tops of her pants. He slow dragged his splayed fingertips up her back, drifting to her shoulders, and then down again. She thrust herself closer, wrapping a leg around his, pressing her pelvis against his. The two of them moaned softly as their tongues entangled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik’s fingers rose up Jo’s back a second time, the tips catching on the edge of her bra. She offered no resistance as the fingers dug under, and then carefully lifted the stretchy fabric up. She pulled back, and flipped the front from her breasts, while he pulled it over her head and off of her arms. Jo posed with a coy smile, her hands above her slightly-turned head, and one of her legs outstretched.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ta da!” she sang.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Gosh, you’re beautiful,” Erik breathed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“‘Gosh’? Did you just say ‘gosh’??” Jo blurted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“N-no,” Erik blushed again. “I, uh… um…”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo slid forwards to him again, picked up his hands and intertwined his fingers with hers. “It’s okay, cariño. I won’t be upset by whatever is on your mind.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is going to sound stupid,” he said sheepishly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Tell me,” she whispered. “Por favor.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. “I’ve fantasized about this,” he said quickly. “Sorry if that sounds creepy.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So have I,” she whispered and stepped closer to him. “A lot. For a long time.” She pulled herself into him, and kissed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Letting go of his hands, she reached down to Erik’s rear, and tucked her hands under the waistband. Erik’s belt didn’t let her hands go in any further than her metacarpals. “Oh, this won’t do,” she mumbled as she kissed him, and with her fingers still under the fabric, moved them to the front. She flicked the end of the belt from the loops, and tugged the buckle open. As she slowly drew the belt from the buckle, she rubbed the base of her thumb against the stiffness that was so eager to escape its confinement. Like most people’s pants, they were old, and too large for Erik’s underfed frame; the belt was the only thing keeping them in place. Jo gave them a slight tug at the side, and they slowly slipped over Erik’s hips, down his thighs, to the floor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo’s hands danced across the outside of Erik’s legs to his waist, always touching skin. Most men had given up underwear during a fabric drive. She slowly skipped across to the front, and brushed her fingers up the shaft of his erect penis. Erik gasped. “Relax, cariño. No te voy a morder … duro.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You said that before,” he breathed. “What does it mean?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo giggled. “You’ll find out.” She wrapped her arms around him, pressed her head into his chest, and inhaled deeply. Then she took as large a handful of his glutei as she could grasp. Then she backed away again, resuming her magical pose. With one hand, she pointed towards her own belt buckle. With the other hand, she deftly undid it. With a few wiggles of her hips, her pants slid heavily to the floor, aided by the various tools she kept in her pockets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“White?” Erik raised his eyebrow in surprise. “How have… those look brand <em>new!</em>”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A girl’s gotta take care of her things, you know,” Jo purred. “Should I make some kind of disparaging comment about you taking care of me—?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik swooped in, bend down and scooped Jo up, one arm under her knees, the other under her arms. He kissed her deeply, her arms wrapping around his neck. He moved to the desk and used one of his feet to shove it clean; dozens of slates clattered to the floor. He laid her down gently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo gasped. “Oh! That’s cold!” she laughed. She stretched out, her arms over her head, her back arched. Erik held her legs up. “I feel like a 50s pinup girl.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik parted her legs gently, just wide enough for him to slip his head between, and kissed her ankle softly. He turned his head and kissed the other. He moved down towards her calf, its definition clear through the softer skin of her leg. He moved across and kissed the other calf. Kiss by kiss, he slowly moved down the calves towards her thighs, alternating side to side. His hand brushed the outsides of her legs, from her ankle to her waist. He felt the thin, silky fabric of her panties. He tried not think about how she had managed to keep them so pristine for so long.</p>



<p>Jo hung her hands over the edge of the old wooden desk as Erik tickled his way along her legs. Every part of her tingled, her skin rippled with goose pimples. At her knees he tickled underneath; his hands traced around her upper thighs. As he passed, she bent her legs, dabbing her heels on his back as he descended bit by bit by bit. Jo writhed on the desk as he crept ever closer to her joy, desperately wanting to pull him in, while desperately wanting the feeling to never end.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I love those little office fingers of yours,” she buzzed.</p>



<p>His nose slid along the panty’s gusset, slick with excitement. Jo moaned softly and fought terribly against her urges. Erik grew small, creamy circles with the very tip of his tongue. His hands slid slowly up Jo’s sides. He exhaled softly, his hot breath washing over her groin. Jo bit down on her lip, and tasted a drop of blood. He pressed his lips against the damp fabric, like a butterfly on a delicate flower. She rolled her hips towards his mouth, but he drew back, chuckling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Atormenta,” she hissed. She reached down to find his head, but found his hands instead, blocking her route. She grasped his hands, and tried to pull, but he refused to budge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His lips returned, fuller and firmer, mapping the contours of the flesh below. He nibbled as he went, slowly circling between her legs. She clamped with her hands, and let out a thin, low moan. His tongue drew a slow, strong line from her perineum to just beyond her clitoris.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Off,” Jo begged in a hoarse breath, and let go of Erik’s hands.</p>



<p>She felt fingers slip underneath the band of her panties, and gently tug. She rolled side to side to assist, and felt the wet fabric skip across her legs to disappear she cared not where. Her anticipation was rewarded as she felt the dimpled wetness of a tongue slip between the parted folds. Jo shuddered with a shattering sigh.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo could barely breathe, her heart raced, her body flooded with so much stimulation that she could almost feel herself shake. She reached down with her hands, and felt the curls of Erik’s hair. Daydreams from her classes raced through her thoughts, of moments they never had, of things she wished she’d done, of them on the greens in a thunderstorm, her room filled with candles and flowers, in front of a shocked class.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She wanted to cry. She wanted to wail. She wanted to release years of pent-up and forced down dreams, to be the woman she’d wanted to be, and for a few moments, not the one she had become. Deep inside, she felt the rush coming. She felt a sense of panic starting to rise, as well: as much as she wanted this, she also wanted Erik.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With her hands, she carefully scooped him from between her labia. He looked up and rose, she tugged him forward. He stroked her skin, from her thigh, over her hip, across her belly, slowly over her breast, up her neck, until his palm rested on her cheek. She pressed her head into it, and tugged on his sides. She felt his firmness slide over her, the heat radiating so powerfully that it was all she could do to not gulp. Her throat felt dry, her palms were wet, and she couldn’t wait. Slowly, achingly, he slid back and forth several times. She rocked her hips as he pulled back, and suddenly years of waiting were rewarded. Again, and again, and again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Somewhere in the ARCH, someone stirred from their slumber. They looked around, confused, certain that, for a moment, they’d heard the banshee. Except that it had come from inside the ARCH, and she sounded far too happy.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">The speed of sound through steel is over 13,000 miles per hour, nearly seventeen times faster than the speed of sound through air. This is why Erik and Jo — lying together in an exhausted, sweat- and sex-infused heap — heard the the soul-shattering sound of girders bending in ways they dearly wished were physically impossible at the same time that they felt the immense wrenching of the ARCH’s structure. The sound was abruptly followed by metallic crashing, the unmistakeable crinkling of rigid structures being crushed, accompanied by the blood-draining screeching of people in various stages of dying.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They were on their feet before the first wave of vibration had waned.</p>



<p>“Shirt!” Jo shouted as she hastily yanked her bra over her head; it came sailing across the room a second later.</p>



<p>“Underwear?” Erik asked, holding the white panties aloft.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Later!” Jo replied, already pushing her feet into her boots while buckling up her pants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two of them burst from the Engineer’s Office, nearly wedging themselves in the doorway. Erik fell back by a half-step, but didn’t lose pace with Jo. Another massive salvo sent the floor out from under them, echoed with a wretched rending of iron. They stumbled, catching each other and managing to miss the floor. They slowed only long enough to exchange worried glances, then ran harder and faster.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The door to the hallways beyond blew open when they unlatched it as a tsunami of people washed over them to get away from the disaster beyond. Jo clung to the door, while Erik hooked an arm through the doorway and around the other side to keep himself from being pulled away with the stampeding survivors. After a few moments, they managed to pull their way through the throng, and squeezed themselves out into another hallway.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The hallway was so full that only Erik could see where to go, being taller than most. He lashed onto Jo, Jo reciprocating with a strong grip on his forearm. She pushed while he pulled, together shouting at everyone trying to flee to make room. But even Jo’s powerful voice was drowned out by the collective crying of the masses. Person by person by person they inched along the hallway, finally reaching an access to the atrium. Long before they could see the damage, they could smell it. Dust. Sand. The <em>outside</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Mierda…” Jo’s voice caught in her throat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Oh my god,” Erik cried softly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A section of the Block 4 roof, a hundred and fifty feet wide, and at least half of that in length had peeled open, collapsing into the heart of the atrium, like some great hand had punched straight down through a sheet of aluminum foil. Sand was pouring in from one corner, where a dune had formed above. The hole gaped like a ragged mouth caught in mid-scream, the fallen section reduced to a jagged wave, partially pierced by the bunk racks that it had mostly squashed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crying and wailing came from all around, much of it muffled by the twisted metal girders and plates. Bodies were everywhere, some whole, some not, most bleeding if not already bled out. A few still moved, though some were clearly in their last moments. Most of the able occupants had already fled to the outlying spaces, a few remaining behind to help.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Find Kelly!” Jo said, as she started to job towards a small group of people standing at the edge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’ll get Francis to get his crew out here!” Erik shouted, heading to the workshop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We need Kelly, first!” Jo argued. “Once she’s out here, we can get Frank!” Erik grumbled something, then changed direction and disappeared.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo approached the group. There were about thirty, mostly men and about nine or ten women. “Is anyone hurt?” They all either said “no” or shook their heads. “Good.” She circled roughly two dozen. “You’re coming with me. I know you’re scared, but right now there are a lot of people who need your help. Follow me.” She pointed to the rest. “I need you to clear that area,” she pointed to a space that had bits of debris, but was otherwise protected under the roof, “so we triage the wounded. Got it? Go!” She took a few steps and turned. No-one had moved. “<em>NOW!!</em>” Nearly everyone in earshot lurched. The group split,&nbsp; most bolting out to Jo and the rest starting to clean the floor, before Jo said anything else.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She directed the rescuers to go around behind the crumpled part of the roof, where it still attached to the structure above, resembling a frozen waterfall. Her instructions were simple: check everyone for signs of life. If the person was alive, try to get them out to safety. If they weren’t, cross their hands over their chests and close their eyes. The first few victims went slowly, until numbness took hold and the group managed to move more quickly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kelly arrived, looking beaten herself. She carried whatever she could in her small duffel bag, which amounted to some twine, some sticks, and her stethoscope.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Kelly!” shouted Jo. “Díos, are you okay?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah,” Kelly reassured her. “I hit the damn door when the building jolted. Almost knocked me out, but I’m fine. You?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I was … downstairs,” Jo replied. “The dead are crossed, the living are starting to pile up over there,” said Jo, indicating three people laying in a row, a fourth being brought over.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Thanks!” said Kelly, starting to run to the wounded. “Let me know if there’s anyone else in there who needs help!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo rushed off, diving into the cave-in, with a whispered hope that she could do some good. Almost immediately, she was met with three bodies, each with their arms crossed over their chests. One of them, presumably a woman, had her head crushed under a girder. A man had been nearly bifurcated vertically. Another man impaled. The blood and sand formed into a thick, sticky red mud. The air stank of iron, stinging at her tongue, burning her nostrils. Jo fought back the urge to vomit, before realizing she hadn’t eaten.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She came across one of the rescuers. Already they looked stunned beyond compassion, working solely to identify the living from the dead and nearly dead. The woman worked quickly, checking pulses, talking to them if she could. The woman couldn’t have been twenty-five, and yet she had now seen more horror in a few dozen paces than most people would have seen in two lifetimes. Instead of following the woman, Jo took a turn, and entered a large gap that had formed when the roof had fallen on top of the bunk racks. Three of them had toppled into each other, forming a support that had kept the roof from flattening entirely. Dozens of people were huddled underneath, some curled into weeping balls, others looked as if the devil itself had just walked past.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She gathered the strong to help the weak, leading them out of wreckage to see Kelly. But there were those who wouldn’t move, or couldn’t be moved. A woman held a man’s hand to her chest. The man had died, from what Jo couldn’t tell. There no force on Earth, not even the Banshee itself, that could have forced the woman to leave. All she could do was tell the woman where to go when she was ready, and that she couldn’t wait too long.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Jo resumed searching, she saw a small, tiny hand, poking out from under a bent roof panel. She moved the panel to find a young girl, three or four years old. She looked utterly peaceful, like she had slept through the entire collapse. There wasn’t so much as a mark on her. But she wasn’t moving. Jo pressed her hand against the child’s chest. There was no beat, no breath. Jo felt her throat clench as her shaking hands crossed the little girl’s arms over her halted heart.</p>



<p>Erik appeared. Jo looked up at him, her hand still on the child’s chest. Jo could neither cry nor speak, her throat completely swollen and her sorrow utterly overwhelmed. Erik stopped, looked at Jo, then at the little girl. Jo’s head shook every so slightly; he nodded with barely a motion, then returned the way he had come. Jo wiped away a non-existent tear, forced herself to standing while pushing away the ache, unconsciously hoping there would be someone to save.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her footsteps were uneven, unable to feel her soles. Her feet were numb, her legs aloof. She felt like she was swimming standing up, like the world was slowing down like a wind-up toy almost out of spring. Nothing seemed right.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A piece of the roof had bent into a neat tent. Inside Jo could hear a call for help. She had to crawl in on all fours, barely squeezing inside. She found a man, his legs crushed beneath a snapped strut. He begged for something Jo couldn’t understand. They were words she thought she should know, certain they were words she could speak. All she heard was gibberish. The man pointed to his waist, which had been bleeding profusely. Jo reached out and touched the pooling crimson with her fingers, and held them up as if they had become foreign objects, beyond recognition. The man grasped onto her wrist, and pulled … but his strength was weak. She couldn’t see him, or hear him, or smell him, or feel him. The man’s hand slipped, the muscles having gone weak and lifeless.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo sat in the little metal tent, absent of thought, unable to move. A roof panel next to her head suddenly broke free, revealing Phil. Jo didn’t turn, or even blink. Phil tried to pick Jo up, and had to get help.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Jo?” asked a voice loudly. “Jo?” A light flashed in her eyes. “Jo!” There was a stinging in her cheeks, shooting sparks across her consciousness, unlocking her fugue. She blinked her tearing eyes, and looked up. It was Kelly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There you are!” Kelly sighed. “Damn, what happened?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I … saw …,” Jo muttered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah, that’s what I thought,” said Kelly. She turned and looked around. “Erik!”</p>



<p>Erik reappeared a moment later. “Is she okay?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No, she’s in shock. Took a while to set in,” said Kelly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No injury, though,” he confirmed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Not that I can see. She’ll be fine,” she said to Erik. She turned to Jo. “You’re going to have to stay here, Jo. Don’t go back in, okay?” Jo looked at Kelly, only partially registering that she was there. “Stay. Here.” Kelly went off to look at someone else.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo sat on the floor, the world buzzing around her, insects flying back and forth within the hive, carrying their loads. Words seemed like a singsong of a separated and discontinuous sounds, recognizable only to those who spoke an ancient and forgotten tongue. She stared at someone, she didn’t know who. The person didn’t stare back, for they had already died. Jo didn’t know what she was looking for, or expecting. She closed her eyes and tilted her head back. She thought it might fall off. It would be a suitable end for her.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The sound changed, registering somewhere deep in her prelimbic cortex. She opened her eyes, and gazed up through the mouth in the roof, to the sandy beige sky above. The sound continued, prodding her. Jo’s head slowly slumped to one side, as her brain fired off billions of warning shots in hopes something would stir. <em>Danger. There’s danger. Danger is coming. She is coming. The Banshee is coming. Wake up. Get up! Move! ¡¡AHORA!!</em></p>



<p>Jo blinked. She blinked again. And she saw the sky starting to darken. A light cloud of sand blew in through the massive hole. She slowly stood up, still looking out the hole. The top of the cliff was just visible, the hard, sandblasted rock in contrast to the torn edges of the ARCH’s roof. And there, on the top of the cliff, looking down on Jo, was the woman in white.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo’s voice filled the remains of the atrium. “STORM APPROACHING!!” The screams and yells came a half-breath later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Everyone to the tunnels!” Erik shouted. “Go to the tunnels!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Like someone flicking on a light, Jo burst further into the atrium, repeating Erik’s orders. She ran through the debris and destruction, calling out for anyone to leave, to run. She managed to nearly circumnavigate the hole before the winds picked up, blowing across the sharp edges of the hole, creating a brutally deep whistle that pounded her ears. Almost everyone else had already fled to the north. Jo swooped in to pick up a stumbling victim and helped carry them out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The space beyond was packed, not a single person was moving. Jo transferred her load to someone else, and tried to push herself forward to find the problem. But she couldn’t move, no-one could. Without asking, she climbed up on a larger man’s shoulders, and saw that the crowd had rounded a bend, but wasn’t moving. They appeared to be trapped at the tunnel entrance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Can you lift me?” she called out to the people around. They all looked back at the arrogant woman who had demanded she be put first. “I’m an Engineer! They’re holding us up at the tunnel entrance. I can order them to let us through!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether or not the crowd believed her ended up being inconsequential, as it only took a few people to start carrying Jo over their heads, passing from person to person, before she was sailing rapidly to the front. She very nearly soared into the air when the crowd suddenly ended at a line of guards, all armed with the sharpened metal poles. Instead, Jo made a fairly undignified landing on her posterior.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the guards tried to pick her up and throw her back into the crowd. Expecting the motion, however, Jo was prepared, and whipped around behind the guard, pressing her multitool’s corkscrew into the man’s neck. He shouted appropriately.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Let them through!” Jo ordered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the other guards spoke up. “Carl said we weren’t—“</p>



<p>“<em>CARL’S NOT THE ONE IN CHARGE!!</em>” Jo shrieked. The crowd’s sudden silence was overpowering. One of the guards dropped his pole. “The ARCH is collapsing. Let them through!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“But—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m about to order them to trample us to get past. You decide!” she shouted. The guards looked at the crowd, who had clearly heard Jo’s statement, looked at each other, and rapidly raised their staffs and stood to the side. The crowd rushed past, knocking Jo and her prisoner to the ground. She struggled to get back up on her feet, and found herself swept into the tunnels for safety. She took refuge in a pocket in one of the walls. She looked down at her hand, which had erupted in pain, and saw the gash. She quickly tore off a piece of her shirt and wrapped it around the bleeding. It was only then she noticed that the injury had likely come from the loss of her multitool.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She couldn’t see the floor, she could barely see the walls with the crush of bodies spreading past her. It wasn’t long before the spaces to one side were full, and people had to press in further. The first level was going to fill quickly, she knew, and it wouldn’t be long before the second and third levels would experience the same problems. Someone else knew it too, and he wasn’t happy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl was yelling, though exactly what he was yelling couldn’t be heard above the crowd. He was shoving his way through, screaming at the entrance. “I told you! Don’t let them in!!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Only a dozen yards away, Jo knew that she couldn’t carry out an effective argument. Nor could she move from her temporary prison against the wall. But she didn’t have to: Erik appeared from the entrance, walking right into Carl’s face. He said something calm to Carl, exactly what she couldn’t hear.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“These are <em>my</em> tunnels!” Carl bellowed back. A few people passing by looked painfully at him, but continued on towards refuge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>Our </em>tunnels!” Erik corrected, almost as loudly. “<em>We</em> have been building these for <em>our</em> protection. And right now, they’re needed, whether you like it or not, your Highness.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl wasn’t deterred. “So long as I’m the tunnelling lead—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So long as I’m the <em>Chair</em>, which you <em>agreed</em> to, you will follow my direction!” Erik jabbed his finger right into Carl’s sternoclavicular joint. “I don’t care if you don’t like it, this is the way it’s going to be. Now get your whiny ass up there and make room. This is no longer a tunnelling exercise, this is a fucking rescue!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl sneered, muttering something unheard to everyone except Erik. Erik flushed, muttering something back. For a few tense seconds, Jo was certain someone was going to throw a punch. However, Carl turned in a snap and drifted away with the crowd. Erik blew out a relieved breath, and pressed himself into the wall, to let people past. He encouraged everyone to keep moving, to find a spot until things settled down. He then looked around, to see who was there, and who wasn’t. It only took him a moment to spy Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Are you okay?” he mouthed silently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo barely shook her head. She wasn’t okay. Not remotely.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">The tunnels were full, more than any corner of the ARCH had ever been. Everyone sat in whatever space they could find, side-to-side, back-to-back, their legs overlapped on one another’s, just so they weren’t cramped up in balls. It was hot, stuffy, damp, dusty, and largely quiet, save for the odd cough. Only those near the entrance could hear the winds, or the rattling of the ARCH’s broken structure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo was one of them. She sat at the entrance of the tunnel, her knees tucked under her chin and her arms wrapped around her legs, staring out into the mostly-vacated ARCH. A rough count had suggested that almost a third of the ARCH’s population had stayed in place. Whether those people were alive or dead couldn’t be known.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She listened for the sounds of failure, for something to snap and cause the entire building to slip away. Instead, it was a more like the sound an old car with loose parts would make when idling. That was all she could hear over the shrill howl as the wind skated over the huge tear in the roof. She couldn’t see the atrium from where she sat, the hallways winding and curving away. She could only guess at what had happened since, having heard some additional collapsing a few hours earlier. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik had set a simple rule: no-one was to leave the tunnels. He had been adamant, the point of looking squarely at Jo when he spoke. Jo had said nothing at Erik’s proclamation, nor had she asked him in private afterwards, as he’d gone off to yell at Carl again for being obstinate about access to one of the tunnels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo rocked back and forth, staring at the empty, unmoving hallways, wondering why she was sitting, doing nothing.</p>



<p>Because Erik had said so.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo rolled her head. Listening to Erik’s orders felt like listening to Batesworth’s. Except Erik’s request was more about safety than superiority. She loathed taking orders. A brief glimpse of the previous night reminded her that some orders had their benefit. She smiled to herself. The sex had been probably more desperation than pleasurable, though it had allowed her to say aloud the things that she had kept within for so long, her personal Hoover Dam bursting apart and flooding out years of desire.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sex. With Erik. She sighed. It was unfulfilling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She thought about love, the feeling more than the act, the comfort more than the pleasure. Was that what Erik was? Comfort? He was the only one who had treated her with enough respect to allow her to be heard. Erik had said nothing afterwards, his doped grin having locked up his mouth. He hadn’t left afterwards, did that mean he’d wanted to be there? Did he love her back?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo sighed again. Two years of university, ten years under the roof. What had changed? A few stolen moments, a couple of orgasms. Erik’s orders might as well had been from days before: stay put, don’t go out. She rubbed at a stab of regret that seemed to form under her sternum. Put down, sidelined by the person she trusted. The person she’d wanted, the one she fell for but had never hit bottom. Affection fleeted away like Henry had in the wind. Who had the previous night been about? Not Erik. She could have just as easily stolen moments from Donner. It had all been about herself. The sex, the repairs, the push for Council, the debates with Carl, the demand for a team to handle repairs, the work expanding the ARCH. A decade of work. It had all been for herself. Professor Batesworth’s class had been for herself. Getting into Stanford had been for herself. Working herself to the bone for a scholarship had been for herself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Had she fallen? Was she still falling? The previous night — now weighing on her without any sleep — almost seemed like one of her dreams: a wonderful thing to remember, shattered in an instant as reality reasserted its unfairness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Silence slowly poured over her. The creaks and the howls continued, but for a short time, there was peace in her mind. There was no answer, no question, no doubt, no worry. The only thing missing was “no hesitation”. And that arrived a heartbeat later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo stood up, and walked back into the ARCH.</p>



<p>The last time Jo had walked through empty halls of the ARCH was during the construction of the various blocks. There had never been a time since when the halls had been completely empty. She moved at her normal pace through the hallway, which was slow and measured, a habit developed to avoid stepping on sleeping limbs. The floors were empty, Jo’s mind simply hadn’t adapted to the newness of the situation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She pulled out her goggles as she got closer to the atrium, the winds carrying grains of sand beyond the hole in the huge dome. She wrapped a thin scarf over her mouth and nose to keep out the dust, and held her hands against her ears to shield herself from the sound.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The roof’s collapse had ceased, laying in a crumpled heap on the floor. Jo expressed a modicum of satisfaction: the floor had held against a traumatic event, even if the roof hadn’t. For an instant, the view looked positively serene, the sand blowing in through the hole like a Courier and Ives snowstorm, settling onto the broken remains like new-fallen snow on a cold winter’s day. Not that Jo had ever experienced such a scene. Growing up in Southern California, all she had known was heat, wind, rain, firestorms, and earthquakes. (She was taken by the thought that she actually missed feeling the latter.) The scene she thought of was idyllic, mythical. She had seen snippets in pictures and films. She had never even held snow in her hands.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Somewhere, under the winkled metal and sand, lay the man who had died in her hands. The little girl whose arms she had crossed. Countless other lives that had been blinked away. Jo wished she hadn’t thought of that, of the lost souls.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She looked at the damage, studying its appearance. She looked at the girders at the ceiling, trying to spy any indication of additional failures. The struts that extended from the ground seemed straight, despite the brutal forces that had torn down the roof. She cocked her head as she looked at some of the girders. It was hard to tell through the dust and sand, and the scratches on her googles, if the girders had bent, broken, sheared. The winds fought against her, however, and she retreated back into the hallways.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The level below had minor damage, all things considered, with only a few places where girders had punctured the floor above. She then headed down to the lowest level, to see if the damage had cascaded down.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The struts she, Donner, and Phil had secured to the reservoir had remained upright, their deviation from vertical hadn’t so much as budged. The reservoir’s concrete showed some cracking at one corner, but the bracket plate remained flush against the wall. She smiled again, pleased not only with the work, but with the timeliness of the repair. One more day, and the disaster might have been complete.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>“I spread my luck around, Kelly,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Too bad you didn’t get any common sense in return,” said Erik, rounding the reservoir wall from the stairs. “I thought I was clear: stay in the tunnels?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah, you were,” Jo replied. “And I did. I just got tired of waiting. I needed to know how badly we were off.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik ignored her reason. “You could have been hurt.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Uh huh,” Jo agreed. She turned and started walking towards the greenhouse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“‘Uh huh’? That’s all you have to say?” he balked. “You put yourself at risk, Jo! You made me come after you! You put <em>me </em>at risk!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You didn’t have to come,” Jo retorted, opening the greenhouse door. “I didn’t force you to come down here.” She stopped before entering. “How did you know I was down here, anyway?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You left footprints in the sand,” Erik explained. “And I’m not done being angry with you for disobeying me!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo had barely made it two steps into the greenhouse. She turned and yelled through the patchwork of glass, plexiglas, corrugated fibreglass, resin sheeting, car windows, and other various materials that made up the walls of the greenhouse. “‘Disobeying’ you?! What am I to you, a child? I’m an Engineer, dammit! I <em>built</em> this place! It’s my <em>maldita job</em> to make sure it stays up! And I’m sure as <em>hell</em> not following any arbitrary, jackass rule you set just because you’re now the one in charge. You used to <em>argue</em> against Rich doing the same thing!!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Well maybe I didn’t understand his reasons before,” Erik explained, following Jo into the greenhouse. The rows of asparagus were in various states of growth, a new crop clearly ready for picking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo crossed her arms. “And you do now, after <em>two days</em>?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I didn’t say I understood them entirely,” he admitted. “Still, going in without someone else to help was a mistake!”</p>



<p>“It was <em>my</em> mistake to make. I knew the risks when I came in here,” she said, checking another strut further in the greenhouse.</p>



<p>“So you made the decision,” Erik commented, as he drew near her. “And what if you had been hurt? What if you had died? You know how badly we need you, Jo. If you were to die…”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Te amo, cariño,” she put her hand on his face and smiled, “but you don’t own me. And you definitely don’t own my passions. And they demand I check the structural integrity.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Your passions are something else,” he said. “I don’t think the winds change that much…”</p>



<p>Erik had thought he was being gracioso. He thought that their recent connection had allowed them to better understand one another. Erik had failed entirely to recognize that such closeness lent more to critical review than it did tacit acceptance. This fact was brought to his attention by Jo’s palm, which even through the padding of his beard, delivered a sharp <em>thak!</em></p>



<p>“Don’t mock me,” growled Jo. “And don’t you ever mock my intentions, no matter how trivial you think they are.” Her eyes burned through Erik’s skull. “You know what I’ve done, what I’ve been willing to do, to keep everyone alive here. I’ve fought for this every day for years. <em>Every. Damn. Day.</em> I’ve made no room for anyone else — let alone <em>myself</em> — just so we can all survive. And you have the cojones to suggest that I’m … <em>flighty</em>?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik twitched. “I wasn’t mocking you—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Really?! ‘Cuz that’s <em>exactly</em> what it sounded like!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I thought we had something,” said Erik quietly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We did,” said Jo flatly, “tequila, and some laughs.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So you have no other… nothing for me?” he asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Of course I do,” she sympathized, “but I have a job to do, Erik. You gave it to me. And those tunnels are now packed with people who are going to starve.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How can you care so much?” asked Erik.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Because I always have. I lost everyone I ever cared about. So I’m caring for those I never knew.”</p>



<p>“It’s noble,” Erik nodded, “but it’s foolish. You can’t save everyone. There’s too many. You’ll kill yourself trying to be everything to everyone.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You can’t tell me how to live my life.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I can keep you from ending it too soon.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How are you going to stop me?” Her jaw was out, she leaned forward, her eyes wide. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik stood, staring at a woman that until only a few minutes before, he thought he loved. “I had hoped I could just ask you to come back,” he sighed. “Instead, I have a horse I have to lead to water.” Jo’s teeth gritted. “I’m the fool, here. I thought we had something, but you … you used me. You got your jollies, and now you plan to hold my balls so you can do whatever you want. That <em>is</em> what you’re doing, aren’t you? You think my feelings for you are going to give you free reign! I have enough problems with Carl as it is, never mind that the <em>dome</em> collapsed, killing who knows how many! The <em>last</em> thing I need is you pulling a princess move like this! I can’t believe I stuck my neck out for you. I should have just left you were you were, reporting to me directly, where I could tell what to do, and where you could go!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You want to tell me where to go?” Jo asked quietly. She didn’t let Erik answer. With reflexes she didn’t believe she had, she connected an instinctively-balled fist into the bridge of Erik’s nose, sending him stumbling backwards. He tripped on the edge of a garden bed, and landed on his back. Blood poured out of his nose. “You can go to hell. I’ve spent more than enough time to know where I belong. And it’s not under your, or anyone else’s thumb. You don’t <em>order</em> me around, Erik. No-one does. Rich didn’t, you don’t, no-one will. I <em>earned</em> the right to be here, and I continue to earn it every day.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erik struggled to his feet, the pain sending massive sparks through his vision, offsetting his balance. Blood poured down his shirt. “What the hell is wrong with you?!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo’s stood prepared, her hands already balled into fists. “Are you going to push me, <em>cariño</em>, or do we have to keep going?”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">“We need to move some of these people out,” said Jo. She stood in one of the intersections of the second level of tunnels, talking with Carl, Smiley, and Francis. It was a tight conversation, the four of them barely able to find space to stand amongst the throng of people that hummed like a relaxed herd of seals. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Finally!” Carl exclaimed. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Did Erik approve this?” asked Smiley. He garnered a harsh look from both Carl and Francis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo shook her head. “Not yet. It’s dangerous to have this many people in here, someone’s going to get hurt. We have to thin out who’s in here, get them into the safer parts of the ARCH until we tunnel at least another level. I think we can agree on that?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl nodded. “Yeah. Exactly. So how many can we put back?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There’s, what, nearly five thousand in the atrium at any moment?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Give or take,” said Francis. “I think I counted around that the last time I looked.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You did a full circuit of the ARCH?” asked Carl. “What does it look like?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The atrium’s shot. About a quarter of the roof went down. The side end is fine, but it’s almost impossible to breathe in there, without the noise. Fortunately, that’s about as far as the damage got: only Block 4 is really affected, and only the atrium. The lower decks are fine, and with the doorways to the atrium sealed, we can easily get back into the greenhouse, kitchen, dining hall, toilets, and the workshop. We can spread people out around the ARCH, and keep some in here. Once the rooms are carved out, we can set up racks in here.”</p>



<p>“So we can move almost half of everyone in here,” said Carl, sweeping his arms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ish,” added Jo. “Enough at least to make things here less cramped. And then we can worry about fixing the roof.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Really?” asked Francis. “Why bother?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Time,” said Jo. “We’re nowhere near ready for the population in here. The longer we keep the ARCH up, the longer we have to get things ready. We might not put anyone back in the atrium, but we’ve got to keep the hole closed so the wind and sand doesn’t do any more damage.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl nodded. “The longer we have, the more time we have to tunnel—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We need to tunnel quickly, Carl. I’m not talking about weeks or months. I’m saying days or hours. That roof collapse was out of nowhere. I can’t actually tell you how it happened. My gut says there was no reason for it to fall. That means we have a critical problem, why I think we don’t have long. But we can’t keep everyone in <em>here</em>. We need food harvested, our waste processing is out there, our core infrastructure is all out there. We’re not ready in here. Not yet.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl nodded again. “I won’t argue.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Bueno,” Jo said cautiously, studying Carl. “Let’s move out who we can for now.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How quickly can we have additional tunnel space?” asked Jo, looking at Smiley.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Smiley looked awkwardly at Carl for a moment. “Eh, two weeks?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo mulled the time. “How many can we get into a tunnel?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“With or without rooms?” asked Carl.</p>



<p>“How long does it take to dig out a room?” asked Jo.</p>



<p>“A couple of days, depending on the rock,” said Smiley. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“How many rooms are we supposed to have on each level?” Jo asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Eighty,” Smiley said slowly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Eighty,” Carl confirmed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How … how do we get everyone out of there and in here?” asked Jo. “That’s not enough space!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’ve got some ideas,” Carl said quickly. “Can we move people out now? We need to get digging.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo nodded. “Sí. I’ve barricaded the atrium from the tunnel entrance, so we can move people out into the other blocks. I suggest we get the gardeners, kitchen staff, and delivery staff back on duty, get people eating again.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think we should move the wounded out, too,” said Carl. “They’re not doing well in here. Is the infirmary intact?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Kelly will have to approve it, but structurally it seems okay,” said Jo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So we’re agreed?” Carl asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Not exactly,” said Bonnie, hopping around people to join the group. “I’m not sure I want to go back in there.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl groaned. “Bonnie, this is a Council call.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bonnie snorted. “You’re a person short. Where’s Erik? He’s the Chair now, he should be making a final decision, right?” None of the Council moved. Jo rubbed her fingers together and tried not to stare too intently at the floor. “Really? You’re going to act like you didn’t hear me?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s not that, Bonnie,” said Francis. “What do you want us to do?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bonnie folded her arms. “Oh, I dunno, maybe <em>find</em> him and <em>involve</em> him?”</p>



<p>“We have been looking for him!” Carl grumbled. “He’s nowhere in the tunnels, and no-one’s seen him in the ARCH.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“He went looking for Jo, last I heard!” said Bonnie, glaring at Jo. “A repeat of the other night?” she asked. Jo blushed, but said nothing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Smiley frowned. “A repeat of what?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Francis ignored Smiley’s question. “Well, where is he, Jo?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I dunno,” Jo answered quickly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yeah, that sounds believable,” Bonnie said. “Out with it!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Francis piped up next. “Sorry, Jo, but this is kind of <em>important</em>. Where did you last see him?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo shook her head in refusal. “I don’t want to talk about it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl shook his head in disbelief. “This isn’t a ‘want’, Jo. This is a ‘need’. Where’s Erik?” he asked sternly.</p>



<p>“You’re not in charge,” Jo snapped.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Neither are you!” he returned. “And you’re acting like it. Now, where is Erik?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I don’t care,” Jo grumbled. “And I don’t want to talk about it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They had a fight,” Bonnie mused. “Big one too, I’d wager.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo’s eyes flared. “Shut up! It’s none of your business.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bonnie stepped around Francis, and stood toe-to-toe with Jo. “It is my business when you refuse to help. Your little lover’s quarrel is getting in the way of getting things done. I don’t know what you two talked about, and I really don’t care. What I do care about is talking to him, <em>now</em>.”</p>



<p>Jo gritted her teeth. “I don’t—“</p>



<p>“What are you hiding?” Bonnie demanded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m… nothing!” Jo balked.</p>



<p>Bonnie snorted again. “You’re hiding something. You don’t want to talk about it. And we don’t care what it is. Erik is needed here, now, regardless of your stupid ego.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>Ego</em>? How the hell—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You strut around here like you own the place, you went to Batesworth when you didn’t get your way, you argued with <em>everyone</em> because it had to be your way, and no-one else’s. You never listened to anyone else’s opinion, and god forbid someone said you were wrong,” Bonnie snarled. “So stow it, missy. Your attitude isn’t winning anyone here today!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl looked half-admirably and half-astonished at Bonnie. He nodded slowly, and looked at Jo. “Bonnie’s right. Enough’s enough. Now.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo looked at all the others. They all looked back at her. The wall behind her suddenly felt far too close for comfort. “The last time I saw him was in the greenhouse,” she muttered. “We had a fight. That was three hours ago. I don’t know where he is now.”</p>



<p>Carl scratched his head. “Alright, we’ll have to just deal with it for now.” He looked at Bonnie. “Okay?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Whatever,” Bonnie shrugged.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Jo, can you get the gardeners going?” asked Carl. “I’ll talk to Kelly. Bonnie, find the kitchen staff and get them running. Then let’s have everyone who wasn’t living in the atrium back to their rooms, and we’ll sort out what’s left.” The group nodded, and broke up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo found Anita and the gardeners in a corner on the third level. They had left the greenhouse, each carrying a plant, in the event of complete catastrophe. “Es el momento de volver,” she said. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“¿Estas seguro?” asked Anita. “Yo no quiero estar ahí abajo si algo más se reduce de nuevo.”</p>



<p>“Creo que sí. El efecto invernadero no sufrió daños, y el RAMC es estable por ahora,” Jo explained.</p>



<p>“Eso suena como ‘tal vez’ para mí,” said Anita.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo held her hands together. “Lo sé. Odio preguntar esto, pero te necesitamos ahora mismo. Todos nosotros. Sin ustedes, nos morimos de hambre.” Jo took Anita’s hands in her own.&nbsp; Sé que usted no se siente seguro. Si yo fuera usted, no me siento seguro, tampoco. Tú me conoces, Anita. Usted sabe cómo trabajo, tú sabes que yo quiero para mantener a todos a salvo. No voy a pedir que te vayas. No quiero hacerlo, y me odiaría por hacerlo. Yo no le pido que vaya, si yo pensaba que estaría en peligro. Es seguro. Confía en mí. ¿Por favor?”</p>



<p>“Okay,” Anita nodded with a grim smile. She waved to the others, who all started to head out of the tunnels. Almost immediately, a wave of clapping and cheering followed them, and they saw every starting to smile, brightness coming back to their eyes. Normally tucked away from view, none of the gardeners spent much time away from the greenhouses, except for sleeping. By the time they left the tunnels, they all walked a little taller. The kitchen staff, as unrecognized as the gardeners, received nearly the same reaction when they left a few minutes later. Normalcy, it seemed, would come back soon.&nbsp;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>The winds were inside; the Banshee was inside.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo stood at the other end of the atrium, away from the hole, studying it.&nbsp; There had to be a way to repair it. They had built it once before, out of scrap bits and a lot of willpower. There was nothing stopping them from doing it again. Except for the wind. And the wind had an awful lot to say.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“¿No has matado a suficientes personas?” Jo asked of the wind. “¡Esta es mi casa! ¡El hecho de que hayas llegado a nuestra fiesta no significa que puedas quedarte! ¡Eres un invitado no invitado!” The sand continued to swirl about in its own conversation, unaware of the animate being’s admonishment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She felt the thumping coming from behind before she could hear it. She smiled and turned: “Look, Erik, I’m sorry for earlier, it’s just that—“&nbsp; She blinked. “Sorry, I thought you were Erik.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donner looked terrible. His face had the look of someone with urgent bad news. “Jo! You need to hide!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo’s face scrunched. “What? Why?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They think you killed him!” he blurted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo’s blood froze, knowingly.“Killed who? Who’s dead?!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donner froze. He hadn’t expected her to not know.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She grabbed him by the shoulders and shook. “Who died, Donner??” Jo’s voice panicked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donner replied. He was so quiet that the hurricane at the other end of the room stole the sound before it had even left his mouth. Jo heard enough for panic to spread from her voice to the rest of her. Her response barely left her lips.</p>



<p>Running was only possible in areas that had been evacuated, immediately slowed by clusters of people returning to the ARCH. She pushed through, careened off of walls and open structures, caught herself on exposed ridges and edges, and even fell a flight of stairs, all in the urgent need to get to the greenhouse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The gardeners were outside, huddled in a group. They whimpered, cried, and consoled one another. A few sat in shock. She rushed up to them. “¿Donde?”</p>



<p>They looked back in horror. Jo wasn’t certain if it had been the horror of the event, or of they had seen something in herself. One of them pointed inside the greenhouse, and whispered: “Allí”.</p>



<p>Bursting through the barriers, Jo immediately drew the attention of Kelly, who was perched over something shrouded behind a row of potato plants, and Carl, who stood beside Kelly. The look on Kelly’s face was enough to convey the news. Carl preferred more direct means: “Stop her!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gary appeared to one side, and Dylan to the other. Jo darted before they could grab her. She ran through an asparagus patch to avoid them, jumped over a row of potato plants, and rounded a water barrel. Gary gave up after the first few paces, Dylan followed Carl’s hand signals to come in around to prevent Jo from escaping.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not that she was going to try.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When she saw the body, all strength went from her legs, her momentum sent her flying to the ground. The small stones that formed the floor of the greenhouse dug into her palms, reopening her scarcely bound wound. Jo didn’t notice, she had gone numb. Her jaw trembled, her heart banged erratically, her eyes wanted to fly from their sockets, her ears heard nothing but the sound of blood draining from her skull. A strained, squeaky whisper eked from deep within, a piece of her soul rushing free from herself to join the one to which it had bonded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No…”</p>



<p>Erik’s body lay next to the potato plants, effectively shielding it from anyone not venturing far enough into the greenhouse to see it. His head would have been facing Jo’s direction, if it hadn’t the appearance of having been imploded. She couldn’t see his eyes, but there was no mistaking the beard, or the shirt. His blood had poured all over the ground, and even the floor’s ability to soak up spills had been taxed with Erik’s demise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gary and Dylan appeared at Jo’s side, forcing her to the ground.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Why?!” Jo cried. “Whyyyyyyyyyyyyy?!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Jo,” Kelly started calmly. “It’s not good for you to be here. You need to leave.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Please! I want to know what happened!! Who did this?!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You did,” said Carl, calmly. “Your little performance there is pretty good, but we don’t give out Oscars anymore.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Fuck you!!” Jo screeched. “I didn’t kill him!!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Huh,” muttered Carl. He squatted down next to Erik’s smashed corpse and prodded a bloody clump with a gardening spade. “You know what this is?” He didn’t expect — or wait for — an answer. “It’s a neat little gadget, with all sorts of little tools … and knives. Like the one that apparently slashed Erik’s throat. He bled out. But you know that, of course.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo’s sorrow had retreated, hiding in the corner as its darker sibling, fear, took hold. “What is that?” She already knew. Fear had already told her how everything was about to unfold. And fear was having a heyday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carl looked at the blob thoughtfully. “You don’t recognize it? Hmm, maybe all that blood does make it a bit difficult. I suppose that happens when it starts to dry from being out for so long—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s mine,” whispered Jo. It had been more of a question than a statement, meant mostly to confirm the script her fear had been reading out to her.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kelly tried to look Jo in the eyes. “Jo, you don’t have—“&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yours,” Carl nodded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I lost it in the rush to get into the tunnels,” she said, holding up her bloodied palm. Kelly immediately grabbed it, and wrapped a torn cloth over the wound.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I see,” Carl mused. “Convenient. And the argument you had with him? How bad was it? Did he accuse you of being abrasive and arrogant? Did he hurt your feelings?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo’s face flipped into fight. “I swear I’m gonna—“ Gary shoved Jo down hard.</p>



<p>“Kill me?” Carl finished. “I wouldn’t doubt it. You did a pretty good job on your boyfriend. I wonder how he looked when you stabbed him. I wonder if all the love you exchanged ran as brightly as his blood.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jo screamed. She screamed in protest. She screamed in anger. She screamed in anguish. She screamed to be heard. She screamed to be freed. She screamed in fear. She screamed against nature. She screamed against humanity. She screamed to be saved. She screamed to kill. She screamed so powerfully that she thought that her vocal cords would shear. She screamed so long that she worried her lungs might collapse. She screamed so perfectly that four nearby glass panes in the greenhouse shattered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Jo had finally ran out of breath, Carl motioned for Gary to tie Jo’s hands behind her back, and wrap another rope around her head, and through her mouth. “Get her out of here,” he said lowly. Gary and Dylan hauled Jo to her feet. She struggled against then, and tried to kick them. Carl walked up swiftly and socked her across the temple with his fist.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Jo’s head flopped about in a daze, Carl came close. “You know, I talked with José after Henry had died. He had an interesting thought,” Carl said. “He told me that the Banshee isn’t outside. She’s right here, with us. You never get hurt, have you noticed that? You’re always the one who escapes death. That’s because you <em>are</em> death. You bring it with you. Everyone who’s died here has been around you, or near you. You killed Henry. You killed the Professor. And now you’ve killed Erik. Well, it stops now.” He leaned in close to her ear. “We’re putting you outside, where you belong.”</p>
