a:2:{s:7:"content";s:4251:"<p>I have a blog called <a href="https://geoff.sowrey.org">The Observer’s Log</a>. It was a place for me to write my stories, tell everyone a little about what I was doing when I was living so far from home. I don’t write much in it anymore, largely because I became disinterested in the soapbox preachiness that I had somehow waded into. I struggled with relevancy and purposefulness, especially where time was involved: I didn’t want to waste time by not telling a story.</p>
<p>That’s what this place is all about: I want to tell new stories. And I hope you’ll join me on this journey.</p>

<p>We live in the Westgate neighbourhood in Calgary. It’s “inner city”, which is not really an accurate statement though everyone tells me that’s correct — to be picky, we’re about halfway out of the city. Despite being tucked well beyond our borders an...

<h2><a href="/stories/the-venerable-santas">The Venerable Santas</a></h2>
<p>I’ve had a fascination with alternate-view Santa stories for a good chunk of my life. This one came after I realized that it would be impossible to cover the globe in a single night. So what if a single Santa could only do one Christmas?
This is de...

<h2><a href="/stories/stories-children/the-threehouse">The Threehouse</a></h2>
<p>When my kids ask me to tell them a story, I don’t get a lot of prep time, sometimes only a few minutes. So when I start to tell a story, I don’t always have an idea of where it’s going to go, and it doesn’t always go well. Every so often, I surprise...

<p>In October 2018, the CBC ran a short story contest. I didn’t really have a hope in hell of winning — the only things I’ve successfully published are short articles. Winning a fiction contest was going to take a whole level more practice than I’d ever...

<h2><a href="/stories/stories-children/the-girl-who-went-up-a-mountain">The Girl Who Went Up A Mountain</a></h2>
<p>For years, I’ve told my kids bedtime stories. Not ones from a book, these were created in-the-moment, often with nothing more than a single word, in this case: “stars”. 

There once was a little village that lay in the heart of a small valley, nex...

<h2><a href="/stories/stories-children/the-girl-who-could-fly">The Girl Who Could Fly</a></h2>
<p>When she was about six or seven, all my eldest wanted to do was fly. I remember those years, the dreams I had where I flew, and the unbelievable feeling of freedom and lightness. 

“No you can’t!” said Trina. She always said “no”. 
“Yes I can!”...

<h2><a href="/stories/stories-children/the-dream-road">The Dream Road</a></h2>
<p>I love trains and I always feel a little sad when I come across an abandoned railway line. It feels like it should be something more important, but our love affair with the automobile led to the death of a trusted friend that we only see in our dream...

Dawn stood near the northern tunnel entrance. Shortly after arriving at the workshop, she had laid into Francis in a way he had never thought possible, threatened to emasculate most of the men, and might have thrown Gary in the smelter had...

<p>“So much for appealing to his humanity!” said Robert as he and Jo raced after Carl. 
“I had to try!” said Jo. 
“I could have stabbed him and saved us all a lot of trouble!” said Robert. “And I would have felt a lot better for it!”

<p>“Francis isn’t going to be happy that we ran out of rivets,” said Phil as he and Gary approached the workshop door. 
The noise from Gary’s mouth dismissed any notion of concern. “So what? We’re moving into the tunnels in two days. After that, someo...
