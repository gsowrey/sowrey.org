It was a place for me to write my stories, tell everyone a little about what I was doing when I was living so far from home. I don’t write much in it anymore, largely because I became disinterested in the soapbox preachiness that I had somehow waded into. I struggled with relevancy and purposefulness, especially where time was involved: I didn’t want to waste time by not telling a story.

That’s what this place is all about: I want to tell new stories. And I hope you’ll join me on this journey.

- [The Venerable Santas](http://sowrey.wp/christmas/the-venerable-santas/) Posted in: [Christmas](http://sowrey.wp/category/christmas/) - I've had a fascination with alternate-view Santa stories for a good chunk of my life.

- [Paradise City by Guns N’ Roses](http://sowrey.wp/soundtrack/paradise-city-by-guns-n-roses/) Posted in: [The Soundtrack of my Life](http://sowrey.wp/category/soundtrack/) - Let's deal with one thing first: Appetite for Destruction came out three years before I went into my final year of high school. I knew several of the tracks from the album, because radio was very much a thing when I was a teenager, but I didn't yet own the album. It didn't really hold anything more for me than…

This was something that friends I would later meet from other provinces (notably those to the west) would snigger at, as they left high school after Grade…
